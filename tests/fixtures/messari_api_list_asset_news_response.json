      "content": "Key Insights\n\nBoba’s main focus is on gaming, NFTs, and metaverse via Hybrid Compute. Hybrid Compute is a key feature that allows developers to leverage existing Web2 tooling for more powerful computation and data usage.\nActivity on Boba BNB’s ROVI Network drove average daily transactions up 1,390% QoQ to 130,000. Boba BNB accounted for 99% of all Boba Network transactions.\nDespite a decrease in BOBA’s price, revenue (in USD) grew 90.5% QoQ due to increased transaction volume.\nBobabeam (Moonbeam) was deprecated in May.\n\nPrimer on Boba Network\n\nBoba Network is a Layer-2 multichain scaling solution with a focus on gaming. Boba operates on Ethereum, BNB, and Avalanche, and it is maintained by Enya Labs. As an optimistic rollup (OR) based on Optimism’s codebase, Boba offers:\n\nReduced gas fees\nIncreased transaction throughput\nL1 security guarantees\nEVM compatibility for smart contracts, such as NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi)\n\nThis network also has unique features that set it apart from other ORs and Optimism forks:\n\nHybrid Compute — the ability to connect to off-chain computational resources, data, and APIs\nMultichain focus\nFast exit bridging to L1\nDAO governance\n\nBoba’s combination of features — specifically Hybrid Compute — enables decentralized applications (dapps) to:\n\nrun at a fraction of the cost of L1 dapps\nleverage off-chain computation via Web2 APIs, and\nprovide the multichain solutions needed for blockchain gaming.\n\nBoba Network was previously active on Fantom and Moonbeam, but those implementations have since been deprecated.\n\nWebsite / Twitter / Discord\n\nKey Metrics\n\nThe quantitative data in this report focuses on the Ethereum, BNB, and Avax implementations of Boba Network unless stated otherwise. Bobabeam (Moonbeam) wound down during Q2, so it has been excluded.\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nNetwork Overview\n\nNetwork activity on Boba Network was a mixed bag in Q2. Average daily transactions was the standout metric, increasing 1,390% QoQ from 8,700 to 130,000. ROVI Network, a multi-purpose “super app,” was responsible for this drastic increase (more details in the Ecosystem Overview section). Despite this massive increase in overall transactions, daily active addresses declined 18.8% QoQ. ROVI Network’s forwarder executes transactions on behalf of users that transact gaslessly, so it barely affects the unique contract callers metric.\n\nBoba BNB quickly found adoption with various types of dapps, leading Boba implementations in nearly all activity metrics. In Q2, Boba BNB had 65.9% active address dominance.\n\nROVI Network is overwhelmingly responsible for the increase in transaction activity in Q2. Boba BNB reached 1 million cumulative transactions in April. By the end of Q2, Boba BNB had processed 12.5 million cumulative transactions. For reference, Boba Ethereum has processed just over 1 million transactions since deployment in 2021. ROVI Network was responsible for 11.78 million of 11.83 total transactions in Q2.\n\nThe average transaction fee decreased 86.6% QoQ to $0.0054, roughly half a cent. This was primarily due to increased transaction dominance by Boba BNB, which had much lower fees than Boba Ethereum.\n\nFinancial Overview\n\nBOBA’s price declined 45.0% QoQ, lagging behind the total crypto market cap’s increase of 0.4%. BOBA is the native asset of Boba Network, and its primary use case is settling network fees.\n\nRevenue (in BOBA) is measured as total L2 fees minus total L1 sequencer fees. It grew 246.6% QoQ to 238,600 BOBA, but denominated in USD, revenue grew 90.5% QoQ. This increase came primarily from Boba BNB, as the high transaction volume brought in more L2 fees as L1 sequencer fees stayed relatively stable.  \n\nEcosystem Overview\n\nAverage daily contract calls increased by nearly 1,400% in Q2; this metric is heavily attributed to “super app” ROVI Network. Unique contract callers and unique contracts called declined 25.0% and 1.5% QoQ, respectively. Due to the architecture of ROVI Network, increased user interaction only scales the total contract calls metric and not unique contracts or contract caller metrics. ROVI Network’s forwarder contract affects contract call metrics the same way it affects active address metrics, skewing them downwards.\n\nWhile Boba Ethereum lost dominance in terms of daily active addresses, its established ecosystem dating back to 2021 continued to have many more dapps and contracts than Boba BNB or Boba Avax. This relationship may explain the disproportionate 63% dominance of unique contracts called on Boba Ethereum in Q2, as users have more options to interact with.\n\nThe major increase in total contract calls starting in February 2022 came from the same addresses becoming more active, specifically ROVI Network’s forwarder contract. Boba BNB is responsible for the majority of daily unique contract callers (76.5% dominance) and total contract calls (99.6% dominance) in Q2.\n\nROVI Network\n\nROVI Network is a multi-purpose infrastructure app that drives the majority of transaction activity on Boba BNB and the Boba Network as a whole. ROVI offers a social recovery wallet, an on/off ramp, and gasless transactions to create a familiar UX for both Web3 and Web2 users. Its token, which has 27,000 holders, is used for rewards and staking.\n\nROVI calls itself a “super app” because it packages many features into a single solution, like WeChat for the blockchain. ROVI integrates crypto through several pieces of infrastructure.\n\nMessaging, such as with existing platforms WhatsApp and Telegram, via Keyboard91.\nFinancial services, such as payments, trading crypto, and earning yield on stables, via M91 Super App.\nGaming, via Gaming91.\n\nIn Q2, three ROVI contracts accounted for 99.9% of all Boba BNB transactions:\n\nThe ROVI Forwarder contract had 6.1 million transactions addressed to it\nThe M91 token contract had 5.0 million transactions addressed to it\nThe ROVI token contract had 0.7 million transactions addressed to it\n\nGaming\n\nMegaWorld launched in Q1’23 and continued to ship new features from its extensive roadmap. One upcoming game is Katana Inu, a player-versus-player (PvP) battle royale game that incorporates NFTs and fungible tokens. The team has released a demo and is working towards its PC beta launch. Homie Wars, a mobile-first, metaverse, battle-to-earn game, launched in Q2. Other games on Boba Network include METAFORRA, Cosmic Universe, and EvoVerses.\n\nNFTs\n\nMany games in development on Boba Network, such as Cosmic Universes, EvoVerses, and Katana Inu, plan to integrate NFTs into gameplay. Boba will likely experience more NFT activity as games approach their respective mainnets.\n\nCosmic Universe is working towards its pre-alpha phase, which will include integrations for the more than 10,000 existing character and land NFTs.\n\nDeFi\n\nTVL (USD) declined for the fifth consecutive quarter, down 17.0% QoQ to $3.4 million. Boba Ethereum still accounted for the vast majority of Boba Network TVL with over 90% dominance. Its dominance is largely due to Boba BNB and Boba Avax being relatively new (deployed in H2 2022) and Boba Network fully pivoting to becoming a gaming chain. As a gaming chain, TVL is not as representative a metric for the overall state of the ecosystem as it is with many other chains.\n\nSushiSwap, an AMM dex, ended Q2 with:\n\n48% dominance over Boba Ethereum TVL\n36% dominance over Boba BNB TVL\n95% dominance over Boba Avax TVL\n47% dominance over combined Boba Network TVL\n\nOolongSwap, the first native DEX on Boba, and Symbiosis, a cross-chain AMM and bridge, are the second and third largest DeFi protocols, respectively, with 22% and 10% TVL dominance. Symbiosis completed its cross-promotion with Rubic to airdrop Galxe NFTs to users in April.\n\nQualitative Analysis\n\nKey Events\n\nNoteworthy events from Q2 include:\n\nBobabeam was deprecated in May. Bobabeam did not host much activity, so development resources were reallocated to the other implementations.\nBoba Network’s $1 million bug bounty was updated to include a broader scope of submissions.\nWitnet deployed a decentralized oracle on Boba BNB.\nNOWPayments integrated BOBA metaverse payments.\nEnjinstarter announced a partnership with Enya Labs to bring a launchpad to the network.\nPetobots, a PvP game, is being developed.\nCaesar’s Temple, a play-to-earn metaverse game, is being developed.\n\nMultichain Approach\n\nBobabeam wound down and was deprecated on May 25. Bobabeam was Boba Network’s Layer-2 scaling solution on Moonbeam and the first of its kind in the ecosystem. This move was made to give additional focus to more active Boba Network implementations.\n\nAs newer implementations see more activity, they also receive adoption from ecosystem tools. Covalent and DefiLlama now support Boba BNB and Boba Avax, in addition to Boba Ethereum, which they’ve supported its launch in 2021.\n\nHybrid Compute and Gaming\n\nBoba Network aims to be the leading solution for gaming and metaverse applications via its Hybrid Compute feature. This feature intends to solve the problem of closed-off blockchain ecosystems. As it stands, blockchains cannot use any data or compute from outside of their ecosystem without an API or oracle. With Hybrid Compute, developers can:\n\nCreate advanced algorithms that are typically too expensive to run on-chain.\nGet millisecond response times.\nGenerate random numbers and other resources that typically carry security concerns in decentralized computational environments.\nAccess low-cost storage, image, and audio processing.\nConnect to external gaming services such as Unreal Engine.\nInstantly mint NFTs based on game activity.\nView offchain price feeds (e.g., CoinGecko) to create variable pricing/actions.\n\nWith Hybrid Compute, developers can leverage legacy Web2 systems and solutions to build higher-quality blockchain games. For example, Boba Avax adopted Avalanche games such as METAFORRA, Cosmic Universe, and EvoVerses, which can now leverage off-chain compute and Web2 APIs.\n\nThe Layer-2 Landscape\n\nArbitrum and Optimism, fello",

      "content": "Inclusion Criteria\n\nThis report aggregates and compares the financial, network, and ecosystem performances of the fifteen Layer-1 (L1) smart-contract platforms covered by Messari through our Protocol Services’ engagements. These L1s include: <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-avalanche-q2-2023?utmmedium=referral&utmsource=report&utmcampaign=stateofl1sq22023\">Avalanche</a>, BNB Chain, Cardano, <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-eos-q2-2023?utmmedium=referral&utmsource=report&utmcampaign=stateofl1sq22023\">EOS</a>, Fantom, Hedera, <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-near-q2-2023?utmmedium=referral&utmsource=report&utmcampaign=stateofl1sq22023\">NEAR</a>, <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-polkadot-q2-2023?utmmedium=referral&utmsource=report&utmcampaign=stateofl1sq22023\">Polkadot</a>, Polygon, SKALE, <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-solana-q2-2023?utmmedium=referral&utmsource=report&utmcampaign=stateofl1sq22023\">Solana</a>, Stacks, Tezos, TRON, and <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-wax-q2-2023?utmmedium=referral&utmsource=report&utmcampaign=stateofl1sq22023\">WAX</a>. We also include <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-ethereum-q2-2023?utmmedium=referral&utmsource=report&utmcampaign=stateofl1sq22023\">Ethereum</a> as a benchmark.\n\nKey Insights\n\nDriven by protocol (Shapella upgrade), ecosystem (meme coins), and regulatory (SEC complaints, ETF filings) catalysts, ETH outperformed alt-L1 tokens in Q2’23. ETH’s market cap increased 3% QoQ, compared to an average decline of 23% for other featured L1s.\nLiquid staking protocols and the downstream use of their liquid staking tokens (LSTs) in DeFi have gained significant attention in 2023. LSTs are replacing native tokens as the prime form of DeFi collateral, as well as leading to innovation in restaking protocols, LST-backed stablecoins, interest-rate derivatives, and more.\nCardano led featured L1s in QoQ growth rates of DeFi TVL, DEX volume, and stablecoin market cap. Of the three metrics, Cardano’s stablecoin market cap has the furthest to still go to catch up to other networks, having ended the quarter at $14 million.\nAvalanche C-Chain outpaced featured L1s in QoQ growth rates of transactions, active addresses, new addresses, and total transaction fees. The surge in network activity was primarily driven by usage of the cross-chain messaging protocol LayerZero.\n\nKey Trends\n\nETH Outperforms Alt-L1 Tokens\n\nThe crypto market in Q2’23 can be broken down into four waves driven by:\n\nEthereum’s Shapella upgrade\nMeme coin mania\nSEC complaints against Binance and Coinbase\nBTC ETF filings by BlackRock and other firms\n\nEach wave was a relative positive for Ethereum, which ended the quarter with a 3% increase in market cap compared to an average 23% decline for other featured L1s.\n\nOn April 12, the milestone <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/01d82721-34f9-44f2-942f-9fe77879d084\">Shapella upgrade</a> marked Ethereum's successful transition to Proof-of-Stake and de-risked staking by enabling withdrawals. Despite concerns about the potential sell pressure from withdrawn stake, ETH experienced a 10% rally in the days following the upgrade. This bullish price action had a positive spillover effect on alt-L1 networks, albeit to a lesser extent.\n\nThe second half of April into early May featured a meme coin craze led by <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/pepe-by-the-numbers?referrer=all-research\">PEPE</a>. Despite the high gas fees, most of the activity remained on Ethereum, as it features the most liquidity (and whales). When PEPE reached its peak price on May 5, ETH spiked around 5%. After PEPE’s top, all L1 tokens sold off as the speculative activity waned.\n\nAfter a period of relative calm, the SEC’s regulatory complaints against <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/e1fbfd61-f6af-412d-a1c4-9deea7a883bd\">Binance</a> and <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/79ad00d4-9b49-40b0-b3e2-6173bd08863d\">Coinbase</a> negatively shocked the market in early June. The native tokens of five of the featured L1s were alleged to be securities in the complaints: ADA, BNB, MATIC, NEAR, and SOL. From June 5 to June 15, these five tokens witnessed an average decline of 29%, while ETH decreased by 13% and other featured L1s dropped by 21% on average. Robinhood’s subsequent announcement to delist ADA, MATIC, and SOL by June 27 exacerbated the downward pressure. Notably, after the initial drop, SOL rallied stronger than the other four tokens named as securities, finishing the quarter only down 9%.\n\nOn June 15, BlackRock <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/73dd45ca-764f-4c2a-a189-b832401a9e46\">filed</a> for a spot BTC ETF, prompting many other firms to follow suit. Once again, ETH performed the strongest after this news, given that ETH is the next most likely candidate for a spot ETF. Although SEC Chair Gensler refused to clarify ETH’s security status during April hearings, its exclusion from the recent SEC complaints and the recently released Hinman emails suggest that Ethereum enjoys a relatively secure regulatory standing.\n\nZooming out, BTC dominance reached 50% at the end of the quarter, a level not seen since April 2021. Historically, BTC dominance precedes market rallies.\n\nUpdate: The recent <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/d0b03f10-ed7c-40de-830e-24aa997d3e08\">XRP ruling</a> was a regulatory win for crypto, although it’s not a closed case. Following the news, alt-L1 tokens generally outperformed ETH, especially the ones previously alleged as securities. BTC dominance has dipped from its high of over 52% near the end of Q2’23 back to around 50% following the ruling. For more on XRP and the ruling, see Red’s “<a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-xrp-ledger-q2-2023?utmmedium=referral&utmsource=report&utmcampaign=stateofl1sq22023\">State of XRP Ledger Q2 2023</a>” and the Enterprise team’s <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/weekly-recap-ripple-coinbase-wallet-and-more?utmmedium=referral&utmsource=report&utmcampaign=stateofl1sq22023\">weekly recap</a>.\n\nLiquid Staking and LSTfi\n\nLiquid staking protocols and the downstream use of their liquid staking tokens (LSTs) in DeFi have gained significant attention in 2023, particularly within the Ethereum ecosystem. By the end of the quarter, over half of ETH stake was in liquid form, including Coinbase’s cbETH, a 25% year-to-date (YTD) increase. This surge coincided with a rise in ETH staking, driven by the Shapella upgrade, which reduced the risk of staking by enabling withdrawals.\n\nOn Ethereum, liquid staking generally offers two advantages:\n\nIt allows tokenholders to stake without running their own validator, which requires 32 ETH and technical expertise. The other popular workaround is staking through centralized exchanges. Comparatively, liquid staking protocols typically charge lower fees, are community-governed, and are generally more committed to increasing validator decentralization.\nIt allows stakeholders to maintain liquidity, creating more opportunities in DeFi.\n\nIn contrast, most other L1s employ a mechanism that allows tokenholders to delegate tokens to a validator and earn a share of rewards. As a result, the first advantage is not applicable to these blockchains. Therefore, users typically choose to liquid stake on these networks in order to unlock liquidity to participate in DeFi. Given the less developed nature of alt-L1 DeFi ecosystems, many tokenholders are willing to stake their tokens in illiquid form. Doing so avoids additional smart contract risk (both from liquid staking and DeFi protocols), slightly lower rewards, and potentially different tax implications.\n\nTo determine how tokenholders perceive this tradeoff, we measured the percent of tokens that are not staked in illiquid form. We categorized these tokens as “free-flowing,” i.e., any token that is either liquid staked or not staked in system contracts.\n\nEthereum led with 91.5% of free-flowing supply, but as mentioned above, there are compelling reasons to liquid stake ETH besides using LSTs in DeFi. Although BNB Chain has a low liquid stake rate, it also has a low overall stake rate, leaving it with around 85% of free-flowing supply. BNB’s high figure is likely driven by the token’s various use cases on the Binance exchange. Comparatively, Solana, Avalanche, and NEAR have high stake rates and low liquid stake rates, leaving 31%, 40%, and 55% of supply free-flowing, respectively. For these networks and others like it, LSTfi offers an opportunity to increase participation in DeFi, leading to a more robust ecosystem.\n\nFor the first time ever, LSTs enable DeFi applications to leverage predictable, low-risk, and crypto-native real yield. The rapid innovation from existing and new protocols targeting this emerging opportunity has spawned a distinct category of DeFi known as LST finance (LSTfi). At its most basic, LSTfi entails the replacement of native tokens with LSTs as collateral across DeFi. On the leading lending protocols of Ethereum (Aave), Avalanche (Aave), Solana (Solend), and NEAR (Burrow), the amount of LSTs deposited has surpassed that of native tokens, and this trend continues to expand.\n\nBeyond replacing native tokens as collateral in lending protocols, innovation in LSTfi has included restaking protocols, LST-backed stablecoins, yield optimizers, interest-rate derivates, and more.\n\nFor more on liquid staking and LSTfi, see Kunal’s report “<a href=\"https://messari.io/report/ethereum-s-ecosystem-is-staking-up?utmmedium=referral&utmsource=report&utmcampaign=stateofl1sq22023\">Ethereum’s Ecosystem is Staking Up</a>.”\n\nCardano’s DeFi Growth Rate Continues to Lead Pack\n\nCardano has now been in the top two of featured L1s for QoQ growth of DeFi TVL, Stablecoin Market Cap, and DEX volume in back-to-back quarters. This quarter, Cardano swept all three categories and also finished second in DeFi Diversity growth. While growth rates slowed this quarter, market conditions were much less favorable, with ADA",

      "title": "Evaluating Validator Decentralization: Geographic and Infrastructure Distribution in Proof-of-Stake Networks",
      "content": "The open-source data collection tools featured in this report were built in collaboration with @theSamPadilla and open for contributions on Github. The repo contains scripts to measure the validator and stake distribution of prominent PoS Layer-1 networks across node hosting infrastructure and geographic location. It currently includes tools for Avalanche, Cardano, Flow, NEAR, Solana, and Aptos. Builders are welcome to contribute to or build upon the project to further the monitoring and analysis of L1 operational decentralization.\n\nKey Insights\n\nOperational decentralization of Proof-of-Stake networks can be evaluated by the distribution of validators and stake across geographic jurisdictions, node hosting infrastructure, and basic software components.\nA well-distributed and decentralized network across these variables is more resilient against buggy code, political and corporate hostility, and physical infrastructure failures.\nStandardized metrics like the Nakamoto coefficient aid in measuring operational decentralization at a given moment in time. But to understand the full picture, it is important to have a qualitative analysis of the factors that contribute to the concentration of stake and a network’s ability to recover in the face of mass infrastructure failure.\nAcross all networks analyzed, Avalanche, Cardano, NEAR, Solana, and Aptos, there is substantial room for improvement to promote long-term reliability and resilience.\n\nA Proof-of-Stake network is most resilient against unexpected failures or adversarial attacks when its validators are well-distributed and decentralized. This necessitates the distribution of a sufficient number of non-trusting operators across non-correlated environments. “Environments” encompass both a validator’s physical location and the hardware and software components used to connect to a network. A common infrastructure failure across any of these variables that affects a significant number of validators could disrupt and, with increasing severity, even compromise a network entirely.\n\nOperational decentralization refers to the distribution of network validators and stake across geographic jurisdictions, node hosting infrastructure, and basic software components. A well-distributed and decentralized network across these variables offers several critical benefits. \n\nFirst, it enhances security by minimizing the risk of a single vulnerability or attack vector affecting a significant portion of the network. Second, it improves the network's robustness by reducing the impact of localized issues, such as regulatory actions or infrastructure failures. Lastly, it promotes reliability. It showcases that a network is capable of withstanding potential challenges and threats, thus contributing to its credibility.\n\nMultiple general-purpose Layer-1s have thus emerged with distinct architectural designs, each attempting to strike the balance between security, usability, and scalability. However, each differing design inevitably faces tradeoffs that influence its degree of decentralization. These design differences make a comparative analysis of Layer-1 decentralization at face value inherently challenging. To evaluate decentralization, one must look to standardized models and control for each network’s unique parameters.\n\nEarly work by Balaji and Lee set the standard for quantifying decentralization with the Nakamoto coefficient, a method to measure the minimum number of entities required to compromise a blockchain network’s subsystems. But the initial calculations and parameters for the Nakamoto coefficient need to be updated to account for the consensus rules of Proof-of-Stake (PoS)-based networks and to hone in on operational decentralization specifically. Moreover, there are exogenous factors that contribute to the concentration of stake, as well as a network’s ability to recover in the face of mass infrastructure failure. \n\nThis report seeks to set new standards for measuring validator and stake distribution across infrastructure components. With its findings, the report aims to provide actionable recommendations to support the operational decentralization of public PoS networks.\n\nThe Role of a Validator\n\nTo measure operational decentralization in a PoS system, one must first understand the core concepts of how validators function, as well as the factors that influence how and where they operate.\n\nValidators serve as the backbone of a global computing platform, executing, validating, and recording transactions for a permissionless network of users. They reach consensus on the state of a chain of blocks, which represent a network’s history of transactions. To add a block to the chain, a threshold of validators must agree. This ensures Byzantine Fault Tolerance, where a network functions correctly even if some of nodes behave dishonestly or fail. However, the liveness, finality, and safety thresholds of each network ultimately vary depending on their specific consensus algorithms and implementations.\n\nTo contribute to network operations, validators lock up, or “stake,” the native asset of the network. This bond serves as a security measure that can be deducted (“slashed”) to discourage actions that are not in the network’s best interest. Such actions include poor performance, such as extended downtime, or malicious intent, such as attempting to produce invalid blocks. Validators are rewarded for their service with a portion of user fees and network inflation, depending on the network.\n\nHow Network Design Impacts Operational Decentralization\n\nWhile there are many nuances that influence operational decentralization, some of the key factors are:\n\nHardware & Upfront Capital Requirements: The cost of hardware to host a node and the minimum stake amount required to (profitably) operate a validator.\nOngoing Operational Expenses: The cost of ongoing resource consumption and validator maintenance.\nBuilt-in Stake Delegation Mechanisms: Whether tokenholders can contribute stake to existing validators.\nActive Validator Set Caps: A network constraint that limits block production to validators with the highest stakes.\n\nTo illustrate, costly capital requirements and resource-intensive physical infrastructure can act as barriers to entry, reducing the diversity of operators but ensuring performant operations. Resource-intensive networks like Solana, with its high transaction processing capabilities enabled by Proof of History, and NEAR, which employs sharding, may require heavier infrastructure. As resource requirements increase, validator operators may favor the convenience of running nodes on hosted server solutions instead of procuring and managing dedicated infrastructure locally.\n\nTo broaden staking participation, most networks feature a delegated staking mechanism, allowing users to commit stake to existing validators instead of running their own. A larger amount of stake increases a validator’s likelihood of producing blocks and earning rewards for themselves and their delegators. However, the more stake a validator operator attracts, the larger the concentration of risk to the network should the validator fail. Networks like Cardano implement a pool saturation mechanism whereby validators that have attracted over 70 million ADA begin to lessen their potential rewards. This, however, does not stop operators from running multiple validators, often using the same infrastructure. While Ethereum doesn’t offer in-protocol delegated staking, this is similar to how operators by definition run multiple validators in increments of 32 ETH.\n\nFurther, networks with a capped active validator set limit active validators to those with the greatest stake weight. This is meant to ensure that only the most performant validators participate in network operations, but in practice, it often leads to a monopoly of active validators that have acquired social capital, making operating a validator unprofitable or unfeasible for others. To participate in the active validator set of the Cosmos Hub, for example, a validator must own or attract nearly 110,000 ATOM tokens, equivalent to $1.2 million at today’s prices.\n\nOperational decentralization is thus highly nuanced; numerous factors contribute to who runs validators, where, and how. Some networks can be highly decentralized in one vertical and less so in others. Standardized metrics like the Nakamoto coefficient aid in aggregating the degree of operational decentralization across validator infrastructure and operational variables.\n\nBeyond Nakamoto: Measuring Operational Decentralization\n\nMethods\n\nInfrastructure concentration, validator distribution, and stake distribution all play crucial roles in evaluating a network’s degree of operational decentralization. To establish a standardized base measurement, both stake and validator distribution is assessed across the following essential variables or \"subsystems\":\n\nNode Software (Client)\nNode Hosting Infrastructure\nGeographic Location\n\nIn the context of PoS-based consensus algorithms, the requirement for finality, safety, and liveness typically refers to a percentage of the total stake, rather than the number of validators. Thus, the Nakamoto coefficient for each subsystem is measured by stake weight.\n\nThe Nakamoto coefficient defines an “operative threshold” as the percentage of failed stake required to compromise a network. In most PoS-based systems, when over 33.3% of stake is compromised, it impacts a network’s robustness and ability to tolerate faults. It will suffer instability and in most cases halt, thereby losing liveness and finality (except for Ethereum which maintains liveness up to 50% of faulty validators). It is important that a network operates consistently at over ⅔ of valid stake to ensure resilience against potential safety issues and maintain overall network stability. Thus, 33.3% is used as the standard PoS-network operative threshold.\n\nSubsystems with a stake concentration exceeding 33.3% in a specific",

      "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe crypto market rebound in Q1'23 was not accompanied by a resurgence in network usage. Despite the featured L1s experiencing an average QoQ increase of 83% in market cap, network usage decreased by around 2.5%.\nStacks outperformed its peers in several metrics, as Ordinals renewed interest in Bitcoin programmability. Stacks led featured L1s in QoQ growth in market cap (340%), revenue (218%), network usage (~35%), DeFi TVL (276%), and DEX volume (330%).\nEthereum remained the leader in most key financial and ecosystem metrics including market cap, revenue, DeFi TVL and volume, NFT volume, and full-time developers.\nUSDC’s temporary depeg and Paxos ceasing BUSD issuance shifted stablecoin dominance toward USDT, benefitting TRON. TRON’s stablecoin market cap increased 30% QoQ to $43.6 billion; all other featured L1s with a significant stablecoin market cap saw theirs decrease QoQ.\n\nThis report aggregates and compares the financial, network, and ecosystem analyses of the 14 Layer-1 (L1) smart-contract platforms covered by Messari through our Protocol Services’ engagements.

On average, the market cap of featured L1s increased 83% QoQ but was still down 58% YoY. STX outperformed during Q1, driven by the popularity of Bitcoin Ordinals which renewed interest in Bitcoin programmability. On an absolute level, ETH’s market cap remained over 2x the other networks’ tokens combined.\n\nRevenue\n\nRevenue is defined as the sum of all fees collected by the protocol, regardless of how the protocol distributes those fees. Jon Charbonneau wrote an in-depth explanation of why revenue should be treated this way, but briefly consider the following example:\n\nBlockchain X collects 100 tokens through fees. All 100 tokens are burned, but it mints 100 tokens to reward validators. If revenue is measured as only fees that accrue to tokenholders, revenue is 100.\nBlockchain Y collects 100 tokens through fees. All 100 tokens are distributed to validators. No additional tokens are minted or burned. If revenue is measured as only fees that accrue to tokenholders, revenue is 0.\n\nThese two blockchains have the exact same end results in fees collected, inflation, and validator rewards, but their revenue would be very different if measured based on fee distribution.\n\nDriven by its relatively high usage and gas fees, <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-ethereum-q1-2023?utmsource=report&utmmedium=referral&utmcontent=intrareport&utmcampaign=stateoflayer1sq12023\">Ethereum’s</a> Q1’23 revenue was $457 million, almost 2.8x the combined revenue of all other featured L1s.\n\nThe most significant revenue growth came from <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-hedera-q1-2023?utmsource=report&utmmedium=referral&utmcontent=intrareport&utmcampaign=stateoflayer1sq12023\">Hedera</a>, seeing an increase of 489% QoQ. It was largely driven by an increase in the usage of its Consensus Service, which enables the verifiable time-stamping and ordering of events for Web2 and Web3 applications. These applications include tracking supply chain provenance, counting votes in a DAO, and monitoring IoT devices.\n\nP/S Ratio\n\nA P/S ratio shows the relative price of a network’s token compared to its revenue. While it can be a helpful gauge, network tokens are new assets that likely require new valuation models, such as the <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/layer-1-value-thesis-the-expected-demand-for-security-model?referrer=all-research\">Expected Demand for Security Model</a>.\n\nThat said, TRON led the featured L1s with a 16x P/S ratio in Q1’23, followed by Ethereum at 188x. WAX stood out as the only network outside the top 20 in market cap to fall into the top half of P/S ratios. Whereas most networks earn revenue from transaction fees, <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-wax-q1-2023?utmsource=report&utmmedium=referral&utmcontent=intrareport&utmcampaign=stateoflayer1sq12023\">WAX’s revenue</a> is driven by a 2% tax on NFT marketplaces.\n\nTRON, Ethereum, Polygon, and Hedera were the only networks whose P/S ratio decreased this quarter. In other words, their increase in revenue outpaced their tokens’ increase in market cap. The networks with the largest P/S ratio increases QoQ were NEAR (100%), Solana (112%), and Harmony (156%).\n\nInflation\n\nInflation from PoS reward issuance is a wealth transfer from holders to stakers. The higher the inflation, the more it helps to be a staker and hurts to be a holder, and vice versa.\n\nBNB and ETH were the only deflationary tokens during Q1’23 at -5.4% and -0.2%, respectively. Both networks burn a portion of their transaction fees. Additionally, the Binance team buys back and burns tokens every quarter, which accounts for the bulk of its deflationary pressure.\n\nGenesis Supply Liquid\n\nBesides PoS reward issuance, inflationary pressure can also come from genesis token unlocks. Genesis Supply Liquid measures the percentage of genesis tokens that have been unlocked, excluding staking rewards. This metric standardizes between networks that have a capped supply, with a fixed amount of staking rewards included in the initial distribution, and an uncapped supply, with infinite staking rewards that are not included in the initial distribution.\n\nMost of the featured networks’ tokens have fully vested, except for Avalanche, Hedera, NEAR, and Harmony:\n\nStacks is around 95% with around 0.5% unlocking in Q2’23 toward its treasury.\nHarmony is around 95% with around 0.6% unlocking in Q2’23 toward ecosystem development.\nNEAR is around 79% with another 3% unlocking in Q2’23 to grants, core contributors, and investors.\nAvalanche is around 73% with another 2.5% unlocking in Q2’23 toward strategic partners, the Foundation, and the core team.\nHedera is around 61% with another ~4% unlocking in Q2’23.\n\nNote that Avalanche and Hedera have a capped supply and these unlock percentages are of the genesis supply (which excludes staking rewards) rather than the total supply.\n\nReal Yield and Eligible Supply Staked\n\nThe rate of PoS reward issuance usually depends on the percent of supply staked and/or the number of validators. Networks rely on different equations to set the relationships that determine where the inflation rate, staking yield, and percent of supply staked will settle.\n\nTokens with low inflation like BNB, ETH, and STX allow holders to freely use the token without being as penalized for not staking, hence the lower stake rates. On the other hand, tokens with higher inflation rates optimize for higher stake rates. Although liquid staking can allow staked tokens to also participate in the ecosystem, LSTs often introduce worse liquidity, smart contract risk, and different tax implications. Additionally, Cardano and Tezos both have liquid staking enabled at the protocol level, but there are still some additional complexities to allowing liquid-staked tokens to participate in DeFi and other ecosystem applications. (For an in-depth analysis of Ethereum staking post-Shapella, check out Kunal’s <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/staking-since-shapella\">report</a>).\n\nNetwork Analysis\n\nUsage\n\nUser activity is difficult to compare across different systems (e.g., EVM vs. SVM vs. Antelope). Each architecture has a unique way of processing and logging transactions and address activity. Additionally, addresses are not 1:1 with users, with the ratio varying across networks.\n\nThe total number of transactions and addresses is not as informative as the economic activity facilitated in those transactions and addre",

      "content": "Key Insights\n\nBoba Network is a multichain, optimistic rollup, Layer-2 scaling solution. Boba is live on Ethereum, Moonbeam, Avalanche, BNB, and Fantom.\nBoba’s main focus is on gaming, NFTs, and metaverse via Hybrid Compute. Hybrid Compute is a key feature that allows developers to leverage existing Web2 tooling for more powerful computation and data usage.\nBoba’s market cap rose by 49% in Q1.\nBoba Ethereum hosts 58% of unique contract calls on Boba Network, despite having proportionally fewer users and activity.\nBoba BNB leads activity across Boba implementations in Q1 with 225 average daily active addresses and 7,700 average daily transactions. New protocols such as ROVI Network are driving this activity.\n\nPrimer on Boba Network\n\nBoba Network is a Layer-2 multichain scaling solution with a focus on gaming. Boba operates on Ethereum, Moonbeam, Avalanche, BNB, and Fantom, and it is maintained by Enya Labs. As an optimistic rollup (OR) based on Optimism’s codebase, Boba offers:\n\nReduced gas fees\nIncreased transaction throughput\nL1 security guarantees\nEVM compatibility for smart contracts, such as NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi)  \n\nThis network also has unique features that set it apart from other ORs and Optimism forks:\n\nHybrid Compute — the ability to connect to off-chain computational resources, data, and APIs\nMultichain focus\nFast exit bridging to L1\nDAO governance\n\nBoba’s combination of features — specifically Hybrid Compute — enables decentralized applications (dapps) to:\n\nrun at a fraction of the cost of L1 dapps\nleverage off-chain computation via Web2 APIs, and\nprovide the multichain solutions needed for blockchain gaming.\n\nKey Metrics\n\nThe quantitative data in this report focuses on the Ethereum implementation of Boba Network unless stated otherwise. Data from Boba Avax, Boba BNB, and Bobabeam (Moonbeam) is labeled as such. There is no data available for Bobaopera (Fantom) in this report.\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nNetwork Overview\n\nBoba Ethereum slightly decreased in terms of average daily active addresses, from 67 to 65. Average daily transactions, on the other hand, took a 28% decline QoQ. Despite the decreased activity on Boba Ethereum, the combined activity of Boba on Ethereum, BNB, Avalanche, and Moonbeam grew. Average daily average addresses across all implementations also grew considerably, with a 132% increase from 146 to 339.\n\nThe average transaction fee across Boba Network has decreased almost 10x from Q3 2022 to Q1 2023, from $0.24 to $0.025. This is primarily due to increased activity dominance by Boba BNB, Boba Avax, and Bobabeam, which have lower transaction fees than Boba Ethereum, benefitting from lower fees on their respective base L1s.\n\nWhile Bobabeam had the highest activity in Q4 2022, Boba BNB took the lead in Q1 2023 in terms of active addresses and transactions. With the shift in transaction dominance, the overall number of daily transactions increased 4% from 13,409 to 13,940.\n\nBoba BNB was the only implementation to see increased users in Q1. Average daily active addresses shot up over 5,000% from 4 to 208. With that increase, Boba BNB averaged nearly double the daily active addresses that Boba Ethereum, Boba Avax, and Bobabeam averaged combined. Bobabeam saw the most significant decline in activity in Q1, with average daily transactions dropping by ~54% from ~11,700 to ~5,500.\n\nBoba BNB’s address activity spiked in mid-February after the launch of Megaworld, a metaverse strategy game. When the game had downtimes, Boba BNB’s activity experienced sharp drops in activity. Some address activity also came from ROVI Network, an infrastructure and consumer platform service. It enables gasless transactions for messaging, payments, and gaming.\n\nNotably, addresses affiliated with ROVI Network are not proportional to transaction activity. ROVI Network provides its gasless experience for users by executing transactions through a forwarder contract. Because this forwarder contract executes on the behalf of users, network address activity does not scale with increased ROVI user activity.\n\nBoba Ethereum saw a sharp uptick in activity at the end of Q1, as daily transactions quadrupled from ~50 to nearly 200 per day.\n\nTowards the end of Q1, Boba BNB reached its peak with more than 40,000 daily transactions. ROVI Network launched on February 23 and is responsible for the majority of Boba BNB transactions. Boba BNB was responsible for over 95% of total transactions, or 30,000-40,000 transactions during the second half of March.  \n\nThe other three implementations (Boba Ethereum, Boba Avax, and Bobabeam) combined for 1,000 daily transactions at the end of the quarter. Notably, transactions on Boba BNB peaked in March, while active wallets stayed at the same levels seen in February. These numbers indicate that active addresses were executing significantly more transactions at the end of the quarter rather than transaction activity being driven by new addresses.\n\nTransaction fees became cheaper as user activity increased on the Ethereum and BNB implementations. Because L1 fees are incurred from batches being posted to the L1, optimal L2 transaction fees only occur when blocks are full with transactions. Boba Network claims to have transaction fees up to 100x cheaper than L1s, which is potentially the case in a time of sustained high activity.\n\nFinancial Overview\n\nBoba’s market cap rose by 49% in Q1, aligning with market leaders such as Ethereum and Bitcoin. Boba’s success is likely due in part to its first adoption on the four new alt implementations which launched in late Q3 2022. Increased activity on the network pushed quarterly revenue denominated in USD up 37.1% from $11,500 to $15,800. Revenue is calculated as total L2 fees minus L1 sequencer fees.\n\nBoba’s market cap was briefly up almost 100% from the start of January. However, it took a heavy dip in early March, when <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/defi-implications-following-usdc-depeg\">USDC depegged</a> and the global banking sector began experiencing headwinds.\n\nEcosystem Overview\n\nBoba’s combined TVL was steady through Q1. While TVL decreased on Boba Ethereum, Boba BNB and Boba Avax saw their first DEXs — Symbiosis and SushiSwap — gain some liquidity to bring the total back over $4 million. Boba BNB and Boba Avax only combined for $400,000 in liquidity. It should be noted that their focus is on gaming and not DeFi, just as it is with the original Boba Ethereum.\n\nSushiSwap has 38% dominance over the entire DeFi ecosystem across Boba Ethereum, Boba BNB, and Boba Avax. This is largely due to SushiSwap’s 42% dominance on Boba Ethereum, which accounts for 90% of total Boba Network TVL. SushiSwap is the top dapp by TVL on Boba Avax and Boba BNB, with 82% and 58% dominance, respectively.\n\nWhile Boba Ethereum lost dominance in terms of daily active addresses, its established ecosystem dating back to 2021 has many more dapps and contracts for users to interact with than Boba BNB, Boba Avax, or Bobabeam do. This relationship may explain the disproportionate 58% dominance of unique contracts on Boba Ethereum called in March 2023.\n\nBoba BNB is responsible for the majority of daily unique contract callers (70% dominance) and total contract calls (96% dominance) in March 2023. Unique contract callers, as detailed in the Network Activity section for daily active addresses, is driven by both MegaWorld and ROVI Network. Because ROVI Network’s forwarder executes transactions on behalf of users that transact gaslessly, it barely affects the unique contract callers metric.\n\nActivity spikes in the number of unique callers did not proportionally affect total contract calls and vice versa. It follows that March’s major increase in total contract calls (from ~10,000 to ~35,000 per day) came from the same addresses becoming more active, specifically ROVI Network’s forwarder contract. The forwarder contract alone executed nearly 300,000 transactions in March.  \n\nROVI Network\n\nROVI Network is a multi-purpose infrastructure app driving the majority of transaction activity on Boba BNB and the Boba Network as a whole. ROVI offers a social recovery wallet, an on/off ramp, and gasless transactions to create a familiar UX for both Web3 and Web2 users. Its token, which has 11,000 holders, is used for rewards and staking.  \n\nROVI integrates crypto through several pieces of infrastructure.\n\nMessaging, such as with existing platforms WhatsApp and Telegram, via Keyboard91.\nFinancial services, such as payments, trading crypto, and earning yield on stables, via M91 Super App.\nGaming, via Gaming91.\n\nGaming\n\nBoba Network’s focus on gaming and metaverse has a measurable effect on ecosystem activity. After launching in Q1, MegaWorld significantly increased activity metrics on Boba BNB.  \n\nKatana Inu is a player-versus-player (PvP) battle royale game that incorporates NFTs and fungible tokens. It announced its partnership with Boba Network in March. Homie Wars announced its beta game and mobile application, which will launch in early Q2 2023.\n\nOther games on Boba Network include:\n\nBoba Avax: EvoVerses and Cosmic Universe\nBoba Ethereum: Metaforra and MedievalDAO\nBoba BNB: Foxtrot Command and Fota\n\nNFTs\n\nCosmic Universe crossed 1,500 NFTs minted on Boba Avax. Many games in development on Boba Network, such as EvoVerses and Katana Inu, will also include NFTs. Boba will likely experience more NFT activity as games approach their respective mainnets.  \n\nYeti Swap, an NFT marketplace originally on Avalanche, deployed an instance on Boba Ethereum. While this marketplace has only facilitated a few swaps so far, it’s yet another example of Boba benefitting from existing in multiple L1 ecosystems.  \n\nDeFi\n\nSushiSwap and Symbiosis Finance’s combined TVL on Boba Avax and Boba BNB increased 8x from $50,000 to $400,000 QoQ. Although DEXs and DeFi tools are not an onboarding priority for a gaming ecosystem, they are still complementary services to almost any dapp or game.\n\nSymbiosis is a DE",

      "title": "Fuel: Supercharging Modular Execution",
      "content": "Key Insights\n\nFuel is a modular execution layer that uses the FuelVM and a new programming language, Sway, aimed at overcoming the limitations of the EVM.\nThough Fuel will ultimately support multiple rollup configurations, its first iteration will be fraud-proof based using Ethereum for settlement.\nFuel uses the unspent transaction output (UTXO) model instead of the account-based model used by Ethereum. This approach helps improve user app experiences with functionalities like predicates, which are conditions for how a UTXO can be spent.\nTo aid developers in adjusting to a new development stack, Sway comes with a toolchain called Forc to allow for package management in one place.\n\nNew players are constantly entering the multi-chain race, with rollups and app chains competing for developer and user attention. Among them is Fuel, a modular execution layer for highly configurable rollups. Fuel introduces an entirely new virtual machine, the FuelVM, which allows builders to tap into a range of capabilities to develop novel applications.\n\nProject Background\n\nFuel V1 was the first optimistic rollup on Ethereum for payments, without smart contract capabilities, and to this day, it is the only optimistic rollup with a permissionless fraud-proof system. The latest round included participants such as Blockchain Capital and Stratos Capital, and the capital will support the development of Fuel V2, which recently launched its third testnet. Though the Fuel stack will contain the capability to function as a monolithic chain, the team is building Fuel V2 as a fraud-provable modular execution layer.\n\nRefresher on Rollups & Modular Blockchains\n\nThere are three main functions of a blockchain.\n\nConsensus: Verifies the state of the blockchain and provides security as it ensures that all added transactions are valid.\nData Availability (DA): Ensures that all data (regardless of veracity) is made available and transparent for the entire node network to view and verify. This provides the guarantee that the chain can be trusted.\nExecution: This layer acts upon smart contracts as transactions occur to update the chain’s state. Computation alters the state of the blockchain and is cued from smart contracts or signed transactions. Rollups, which are execution environments, execute transactions on separate blockchains and post the compressed transaction data back to the L1.\n  Settlement: The settlement layer handles proofs and settles disputes — it is also where finality occurs and is baked into the monolithic model. Sovereign rollups have their own settlement function.\n\nBecause monolithic blockchains handle all these functions on one chain, they quickly become inefficient, creating the blockchain trilemma. In the case of Ethereum, as usage increased, the execution function was outsourced to rollups so that the Layer-1 (L1) could focus on security and decentralization. Because rollups have smart contracts on Ethereum to verify state, they inherit its security.\n\nBut rollups can scale only so much as the capacity of the DA solution it uses. For example, since Ethereum handles all the functions of a monolithic chain, its DA capacity creates an upper limit for rollup scalability. Celestia, previously known as LazyLedger, a modular DA layer, championed the concept of a modular blockchain. It was built to only focus on DA and consensus and handles a bigger DA capacity than Ethereum, allowing for better rollup performance.\n\nWhere Fuel Fits in the Modular Blockchain Stack\n\nAs a modular execution layer, Fuel can effectively be used as part of a monolithic chain or as an execution environment that uses separate layers for settlement, consensus, and data availability. With modularity at its core, Fuel can achieve high bandwidth because it is not limited to any one configuration. The first implementation of Fuel will be an optimistic rollup that settles to Ethereum; but the execution layer is ultimately proof and chain-agnostic.\n\nThe Fuel Architecture\n\nRelatively speaking, the EVM is slow and expensive. Ethereum also struggles to make changes to the EVM as they may affect backward compatibility, which ensures that new upgrades or forks will not break existing smart contracts. These limitations prompted the development of FuelVM, which has been designed to surpass the limits of the EVM and includes coveted features such as efficient transaction processing and safety measures built into the accompanying programming language from the get-go.\n\nThe UTXO Model\n\nFor its accounting model, Fuel uses the UTXO model, inherited from Bitcoin. In the UTXO model, assets are stored on the ledger as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) between addresses. In a transaction, unspent outputs are consumed to create new outputs.\n\nBy contrast, the account-based model adds and subtracts transactions from addresses stored in a database of network states. Ethereum, Solana, all EVM-based chains, and many other smart contract networks use an account-based model, which is similar to how accounts work within banks. As a user (owner of the private key) signs a transaction to transfer tokens, their accounts are debited that amount, while the receiver’s account is credited with that amount.\n\nBecause Fuel uses the UTXO model, it does not use wallets or accounts. Instead, every prompted transaction burns and creates tokens. Each UTXO is uniquely identified and can only be spent once, which helps prevent double-spend. In addition to a coin UTXO that UTXO-based systems typically have, Fuel also has contract UTXOs, which contain amount of coins, contract ID, hash, and a storage root.\n\nParallel Order Processing\n\nThe use of UTXOs enables parallel order processing, where orders which have no dependence on each other can be executed in parallel, across multiple CPU threads at once.\n\nFuelVM uses strict access lists to enable parallelization. That is, each transaction has to include what contracts it may touch to avoid simultaneously executing transactions that affect the same contract. Parallelization generates dramatically higher throughput compared to ordering transactions, a driver of EVM inefficiency.\n\nHow Fuel Navigates Concurrency\n\nBecause the EVM stores global state, different agents can interact with its smart contracts. With UTXOs, the concurrency problem may occur, which is where a UTXO can only be used once as well as the smart contract associated with it. <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/cardano-slow-and-steady?referrer=all-research\">Cardano utilizes an extended UTXO model</a> and has faced this issue, particularly in DeFi applications. A bottleneck is created because transactions typically require multiple users to interact with a single smart contract at once, but concurrency prevents them from doing so.\n\nThe use of contract UTXOs helps Fuel avoid this issue. Since contract UTXOs are uniquely identified by their contract ID, users provide contract IDs for contracts they intend to interact with instead of UTXO IDs. Then, it is up to the block producers to decide which UTXO a transaction will spend and the resulting state of the associated contract. Each transaction consumes the contract UTXO and a new one with a new state is created.\n\nMinimizing State Through Scripts & Predicates\n\nThe FuelVM supports the following program types: smart contracts, scripts, libraries, and predicates. Unlike the EVM, where each interaction with a contract is a separate transaction, FuelVM can call multiple contracts in one transaction with a script.\n\nPredicates are the conditions under which a UTXO can be spent. A predicate evaluates to either True or False to determine if a transaction will take place. If a predicate does not match its authorized condition, the transaction is invalid – it does not get included in a block, and no gas is spent. This is possible because transaction outputs rely on outputs from previous transactions, forcing a level of atomicity. The cost and validity of transactions can be predicted prior to execution. Fees can also be predicted as there is no arbitrary ordering based on a gas variable.  \n\nThe main benefits of UTXO and predicates are the minimization of state growth and the introduction of <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/a-path-towards-account-abstraction-with-erc-4337\">account abstraction</a> (AA). As blockchains grow, they are prone to state bloat. State bloat results in increased pressure on the chain’s performance and the requirements for running nodes. As fewer nodes can keep up with the resulting hardware costs, the risk of centralization grows. Rollups offload some state growth from the L1, but unfortunately, they are also prone to state bloat as usage increases.\n\nSince scripts and predicates do not store data as a smart contract does, they do not contribute to state growth. Without this impending strain on Fuel, it can continuously sustain users and their activity as it grows.\n\nBecause each UTXO takes in multiple inputs and create corresponding outputs, it is easier to involve multiple users in a transaction. With the EVM, a multisig is a set of permanent contracts, but with FuelVM, native multisigs let users set up a predicate to initiate transactions, without storing state on-chain. This yields faster and more efficient activity for groups of users.\n\nAccount Abstraction via Predicates\n\nUTXOs and predicates naturally result in account abstraction, which allows for programmable transaction validation. Further, Fuel implements stateless account abstraction, which means it doesn’t depend on external state and doesn’t contribute to state bloat. On Fuel, one can program a predicate to be spent based on an output, e.g., the transaction is only valid if X happens. Developers are also able to define custom verification schemes at the application level, since AA is not prescribed to the protocol.  \n\nEthereum is <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/a-path-towards-account-abstraction-with-erc-4337?referrer=all-research\">on its way</a> to including AA in the core protocol, b",

      "content": "Key Insights\n\nEthereum’s upgrade to Proof-of-Stake made it more resistant to shocks from the market. While ETH ended the quarter down 10%, it outperformed close peers such as BTC and SOL.\nThe Merge significantly improved key financial fundamentals for Ethereum. Gross protocol issuance was down 87% and was more than offset by the transaction fee burn. Real validator returns increased from 0% to 6%.\nThe community was able to overcome its first major challenge of censorship in this new era. Combined efforts between Flashbots and the validators brought censorship down from 78% to 61%.\nNetwork usage metrics were down across the board as they are typically positively correlated with market sentiment. Transactions, active addresses, decentralized exchange, and lending volumes were all down for the quarter.\nNo bear market among Layer-2 solutions. The Q4 trend was the opposite for Layer-2 solutions with transaction activity almost matching that on Layer-1. With further improvements around the corner, this trend is likely to continue.\n\nPrimer on Ethereum\n\nThe Ethereum blockchain network is a decentralized computation, data storage, and transaction validation platform. The breakthrough introduction of smart contracts and a virtual machine on the network creates a decentralized Turing-complete software solution. There are thousands of individual tokens and applications built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol gained broad recognition after developing a deep decentralized finance ecosystem and, more recently, interesting Web3 use cases. The protocol made the transition to Proof-of-Stake from Proof-of-Work on September 15, 2022. The next step for Ethereum is to meet the growing demand for blockspace by creating a network of Layer-2 solutions that enable it to scale throughput while maintaining decentralization. Today, Ethereum is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nKey Metrics\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nFinancial Overview\n\nThe quarter was tumultuous with the <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/ftx-meltdown-implications-and-insights\">bankruptcy of FTX / Alameda</a> casting a huge shadow over the cryptoasset ecosystem. However, unlike most other cryptoassets, ETH did not set a new cycle low. Even though ETH ended the quarter down, it outperformed its closest peers. This outperformance came on the back of recent and upcoming upgrades that improve the fundamentals of the protocol.\n\nThe Merge (Ethereum’s transition to Proof-of-Stake) successfully took place at the tail end of Q3. Q4 was the first quarter to feel the full effects of this massive upgrade. Among other things, The Merge brought significant improvements to the financials of the protocol.\n\nNow that Ethereum mints fewer coins than it burns, it has become one of the few “profit-generating” blockchains. With the transition to Proof-of-Stake, miner rewards were eliminated, and gross issuance fell by 87% to just 156,000 ETH. Gross issuance was surpassed by the 160,000 ETH in burned transaction fees, bringing net issuance to roughly -4,000 ETH. This net negative inflation suggests that Ethereum’s economic policy is sustainable, and the protocol is sufficiently secured by usage.\n\nThe Merge also vastly improved the economics for stakers. Real staking returns improved from 1% in Q3 to 6% in Q4. The majority of the increase came from a fall in net inflation from 4% to 0%. Fees from tips and MEV formed only a small part of validators’ incomes. However, for a brief period in November, yields shot up over 10% due to the MEV opportunities following the FTX hacker’s trades. If sentiment improves and on-chain activity returns in the coming quarters, validator income could see further growth.\n\nWith its rising staking yield, Ethereum now has the highest staked market cap of all PoS chains, sitting at $19 billion. However, its staking ratio is still much lower than chains such as Solana, Avalanche, and Polkadot. So far, Ethereum’s staking experience has been subpar since ETH, once staked, is unable to be withdrawn. Ethereum’s next upgrade will enable staking withdrawals that will derisk staking and likely improve the staking ratio. A higher staking ratio would create greater security for the chain and a lower floating supply for ETH.\n\nNetwork Overview\n\nA smooth Merge did not rob users of on-chain drama. The network faced its first major challenge when validators started <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/ethereum-s-compliance-concerns-are-greatly-exaggerated\">censoring transactions</a> from addresses banned by the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC). The portion of blocks by censoring relays peaked at 78% in the middle of November. However, the community, led by the Flashbots team, was able to bring down OFAC compliance to 61% by the end of the quarter. An updated Ethereum roadmap now includes “The Scourge” which will ensure it has “reliable and credibly neutral transaction inclusion.”\n\nTransaction count on Ethereum saw a minor dip in Q4 after having remained largely range-bound for the whole year. Average daily transactions for the quarter were 1.1 million, down 8% from Q3. NFTs and ETH transfers were the largest contributors to the negative growth, falling 38% and 23%, respectively. Some of this decrease was offset by an increase in activity from ERC-20 tokens, pegged assets, and decentralized finance, up 36%, 22%, and 17%, respectively.\n\nDaily active addresses followed a similar pattern to transactions, falling 12% to 440,000 for the quarter. Ironically, active addresses for Ethereum hit an all-time high of 1.4 million in early December, but it was because of a rather mundane reason: Binance was consolidating its wallets for its <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/understanding-the-functions-and-limitations-of-proof-of-reserves\">Proof-of-Reserves</a> audit. Typically market sentiment and on-chain activity are positively correlated, and as such, it is no surprise that on-chain metrics were unimpressive in Q4.\n\nOn a more positive note, Q4 added unique addresses almost twice as fast as Q3. A total of 12 million new unique addresses were added, bringing total unique addresses to 218 million at the end of the quarter.\n\nMarket Metrics\n\nBroadly speaking, Ethereum performed poorly relative to the vast majority of asset classes. This poor performance can be largely attributed to the panic selling that followed the crash of FTX. The black swan event was in no way tied to the performance or integrity of Ethereum’s network, but it still cast a broad shadow over the crypto market.\n\nNevertheless, Ethereum was able to outperform Bitcoin in a down quarter. Its performance could be due to its lower inflation and reduced technology risk. It could also be a signal that Ethereum is perceived as a safe haven within the digital asset class.\n\nDue to the systematic risk realized by FTX’s bankruptcy, Ethereum experienced abnormal correlations this quarter relative to Q3 and the last 12 months. For example, there was a moderate positive correlation with the U.S. Dollar Index which traditionally maintains a strong negative correlation with digital assets. Despite this abnormal behavior, the digital asset maintained a strong positive correlation with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, NASDAQ 100, S&P 500, and Russell 2000 over the last 12 months. Conversely, it maintained a strong negative correlation with the U.S. Dollar Index and 10-Year Treasury Yield over the same period.\n\nEthereum realized volatility continued its downward trend from Q3 with a temporary spike around the FTX bankruptcy. This decline in realized volatility subsequently led to fewer liquidations in the quarter. The exceptions to this trend, outside liquidations surrounding FTX, were short liquidations on October 26-27 and October 29-30, totaling $598.06 million and $507.38 million, respectively. This was due to spot prices breaking and first holding above $1,500, then $1,600, and finally creating a short squeeze. Notably, futures open interest finished slightly down, indicating potential weakness in the bearish trend.\n\nSectoral Overview\n\nStablecoins\n\nUnsurprisingly, stablecoin supply shrank in Q4, likely due to investors exiting the asset class following the bankruptcy of FTX. Supply bumped higher in early November during the market selloff leading into the announcement of FTX’s bankruptcy. Then supply began to decline more quickly as investors converted to fiat currencies for withdrawals off exchanges. Remarkably, USDC and USDT supply diverged from the overall trend and experienced a sharp increase in supply on December 13. While USDT supply finished flat for the quarter, USDC supply increased 2%. BUSD experienced a 15% decline in supply over the same 24 hour period.\n\nThese trends can be partially explained by two distinct events tied to the stablecoin market. First, Coinbase announced on December 9 that it would be waiving fees for global retail customers to convert USDT to USDC. The exchange urged its users to switch to USDC due to concerns that USDT would not be able to hold its peg to the U.S. dollar. USDT traded as low as 93 cents following FTX’s bankruptcy.\n\nSecond, following the bankruptcy of FTX, investors were skeptical of other unregulated exchanges domiciled outside the United States, namely Binance. This skepticism likely contributed to investors converting out of BUSD and into USDC and USDT as well as outright withdrawing from the exchange. Binance even briefly paused USDC withdrawals to facilitate token swaps of USDC for BUSD.\n\nDecentralized Exchanges (DEXs)\n\nIn Q3, DEXs averaged $12 billion in weekly transaction volume. In Q4, this dropped to $10 billion. Uniswap’s dominance decreased from 69% at the end of Q3 to 53% at the end of December. Uniswap’s average dominance was 64% throughout Q4. Notably, Curve’s volume share increased from 11% at the end of Q3 to 28% at the end of December.\n\nBorrowing and Lending\n\nDaily lending volumes were nearly halved in Q4, falling 46%. ",

Behind the scenes, the picture was brighter as Ethereum continues to dominate smart contract network developer share.\nUser activity did pick up on Layer-2 as Ethereum’s rollup-centric roadmap seems to be slowly materializing. Total value locked on both Optimism and Arbitrum reached $1 billion.\nA successful transition to Proof-of-Stake just prior to the release of this report set up a new era for Ethereum. With a 99% reduction in energy usage, a potentially deflationary underlying currency, and an investable yield, Ethereum may finally find some of the institutional adoption proponents have long clamored for.\n\nA Primer on Ethereum\n\nThe Ethereum Blockchain network is a decentralized data storage and transaction validation platform. The breakthrough introduction of smart contracts and a virtual machine on the network creates a decentralized Turing-complete software solution. There are thousands of individual tokens and applications built on top of the Ethereum blockchain. The protocol gained broad recognition after developing a deep decentralized finance ecosystem and, more recently, many interesting Web3 use cases. The protocol made the transition to Proof-of-Stake from Proof-of-Work on September 15, 2022. Today, Ethereum is the world’s second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization.\n\nKey Metrics\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nQuarter Highlights\n\nCrypto markets rebounded in Q3 2022, partially recovering from the Terra and macro-induced meltdown in Q2. Ether outperformed from a price perspective in anticipation of the changing tokenomics and users accumulating spot assets on the potential for airdrops stemming from The Merge. On September 15, Ethereum successfully executed its consensus change from Proof-of-Work (PoW) to Proof-of-Stake (PoS). This transition ushered in a new era for the largest smart contract platform. Post-Merge, daily block rewards declined from roughly ~13,500 ETH to ~2,000 ETH, which has greatly reduced the network’s security expense.\n\nActive addresses and transactions have remained largely stable for Ethereum with relatively minor changes QoQ. While addresses and volumes may tick up with wider crypto adoption, Ethereum’s scaling will come from Layer-2 solutions rather than a more performant base layer.\n\nThe protocol’s revenue was brought down by the combination of another crypto bear market, increased volume on L2s, and the upgrades in protocol contracts for gas efficiency. Consequently, total fees fell off a cliff in Q3, dropping to their lowest levels since 2020. If these fees continue to fall into the back half of the year, they will directly impact the staking yields in a post-Merge world.\n\nNetwork Performance\n\nEthereum transaction count has remained largely range-bound since the implementation of EIP-1559 in August 2021. Post EIP-1559, the gas fee for the next block changes in the opposite direction whenever blocks are filled above or below the target limit. The new setup has effectively reduced the variance in the number of transactions per block by having the transaction fee absorb the variance.\n\nOver the quarter, average daily transactions were 1.2 million, up 6% from the previous quarter. Growth was observed in ETH transfers and DeFi transactions growing 7% and 14% to 415,000 and 82,000 average daily transactions, respectively. On the other hand, NFT and bridge transactions declined. NFT transactions fell 17% over the quarter to 181,000 transactions per day, and bridge transactions fell by 41% to 9,000 transactions per day.\n\nActive addresses naturally followed a similar pattern to transactions. There were 550,000 daily active addresses for the quarter, up 5% from the previous quarter. The growth was primarily due to a spike in active addresses on July 27, 2022, when Chandler Guo, a prominent Ethereum miner, announced plans for an Ethereum PoW fork, along with some wallet “maintenance activity” from Binance. Most importantly, the activity likely wasn’t due to a new influx of users or a novel application.\n\nOver the period, Ethereum supply grew by 0.7%, or 4.2% annualized. All of the inflation came from PoW rewards as the burn from transaction base fees was slightly higher than the inflation from Beacon Chain rewards.\n\nETH in smart contracts has trended upwards since 2020 as the asset is increasingly used within DeFi and other applications. This has translated to a multi-year decrease in ETH held on centralized exchanges. However, the collapse of Terra seemed to have eroded trust in smart contracts even across ecosystems. The percentage of ETH in smart contracts peaked at 30% on May 9, 2022, the same day as Terra’s collapse, and has since trended downwards. ETH on smart contracts at the end of August stood at 27%, falling 2% from the end of June.\n\nMarket Metrics\n\nUnsurprisingly, bullish bets by traders increased in Q3 as the timeline for The Merge was finalized. Since the official target block difficulty was set in mid-July, indicating a mid-September Merge date, call volume steadily increased across exchanges. Call volume at the end of August more than doubled the levels seen at the end of June.\n\nThe ratio of calls to puts also increased. The strike prices for these calls was largest at the $5,000 level for the September 30 expiry and $2,500 for the December 30 expiry. ETH hovered around $1,500 for the last few months when these bets would have been placed. The strike prices for these call volumes indicate many gamblers are targeting the September expiry (i.e., expecting ETH to more than triple) while the more fundamental investors are looking at the December contract.\n\nAs sentiment shifted and the price of Ether slowly marched higher, volatility trended downwards. Ether had a much tighter range of daily moves throughout July and August. This decline in absolute volatility was seen across the crypto and equities markets after a very challenging Q2. Ethereum’s correlation to Bitcoin remained near 90% while its correlation to the S&P 500 trended down slightly.\n\nLayer-2 Analysis\n\nEthereum’s rollup-centric scaling plan is finally materializing. While the average transaction count for Ethereum may have remained range-bound, there was meaningful growth in L2 transactions. Average transactions on Arbitrum grew almost three times, from 39,000 in January 2022 to 115,000 in August 2022. Over the same period, transactions on Optimism also grew almost 3.5 times from 41,000 to 142,000.\n\nEmerging underlying ecosystems are driving L2 activity. L2 applications have attracted real usage and attention, namely GMX on Arbitrum and Synthetix on Optimism. These applications are also among the biggest drivers for TVL on their respective platforms. However, some of this growth may be attributed to mercenary capital rather than organic users, as OP incentives went live and an Arbitrum airdrop is anticipated.\n\nMore catalysts for L2 growth and adoption are coming this year:\n\n<a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/fb8aba16-51d8-47a3-aac9-49af5d37b90a\">Arbitrum’s Nitro upgrade</a> recently went live with higher throughput and lower fees. With the upgrade locked in, <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/6c6ddf51-4d46-489e-922c-6ce3b419048b\">Arbitrum Odyssey</a> is expected to resume again which will lead up to its token launch.\n<a href=\"https://messari.io/report/the-big-three-zkevm-announcements-what-you-need-to-know-and-potential-implications\">Three different teams</a> announced breakthroughs with zkEVMs: Polygon, zkSync, and Scroll. zkSync’s zkEVM is expected to launch its mainnet in Q4.\nStarkNet announced <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/analyst-note-starknet-s-plan-to-decentralize\">plans to decentralize and launch its own token</a>.\n\nThese token launches with airdrops are important events for the ecosystem. They drive usage to the platforms and help create a community of user investors. However, they may ultimately be an unsustainable approach to adoption. Rather, these ecosystems need to create organic user adoption to thrive long term.\n\nSector Analysis\n\nDecentralized Exchanges (DEXs)\n\nIn Q2, DEXs had an average of $2.78 billion in daily transaction volume. In Q3, this dropped to $1.83 billion. YoY volumes are also down to the tune of roughly $800 million. Uniswap dominance increased from 60% at the end of Q2 to 72% at the end of August. Uniswap remained consistently at ~75% of DEX market share throughout Q3. Notably, Curve’s volume share fell from 16% down to 8% despite continuing to issue higher incentives than the competition.\n\nBorrowing and Lending\n\nAverage lending volumes declined sharply in Q3. The daily average fell from $280 billion per day in Q2 to $116 billion. July was a notably slow month before volumes picked up slightly in August, as demand for spot ETH increased for individuals looking to farm the ETH POW airdrop.\n\nNFTs\n\nWhile the average NFT daily trading volumes dropped dramatically, the average number of daily traders witnessed a much smaller decline. This indicates a sticky base of committed users at around 40,000 per day. Volume in dollar terms fell 90% from January. Sales have averaged less than $1 billion per month in Q3 compared to $4.6 billion in Q2. The decline is not only to do with a slowing market for NFTs but also the drop in ETH price which most NFTs use as their base currency. OpenSea continued to dominate market share in Q3.\n\nSudoswap launched in Q3. It provides a new take on the NFT marketplace by creating liquidity pools for NFTs similar to a Uniswap for NFTs. Although volumes seem to have peaked in August, sudoswap will be worth monitoring when (if) the NFT market downturn reverses.\n\nStablecoins\n\nStablecoins are the liquidity for the decentralized finance ecosystem. Turning points in stablecoin velocity have followed the overall ",

      "content": "Key Insights\n\nLido is a non-custodial liquid staking protocol for Ethereum, Solana, Kusama, Polygon, and Polkadot.\nLido abstracts away the challenges and risks around maintaining staking infrastructure by allowing users to delegate their assets, in any sum, to professional node operators.\nStakers receive liquid, tokenized staking derivatives, also known as Lido-staked assets (stAssets), to represent their claim on the underlying stake pool and its yield.\nstAssets effectively unlock liquidity and remove the opportunity cost of staking since they can be used on a number of popular DeFi protocols to generate additional yield.\nNode operators are added to Lido through a DAO vote and are responsible for the actual staking.\nLido is currently the fourth largest protocol by total value locked (TVL) and accounts for almost one-third of all staked ETH.\n\nStaking, a cryptoeconomic primitive that allows participants to earn yield in exchange for locking tokens, has taken center stage over the past two years. Much of the attention comes from the shift to Proof-of-Stake (PoS) as the dominant consensus mechanism for smart contract platforms. Under PoS, instead of using computational power, validators lock (“stake”) a certain amount of the network’s native cryptoasset as collateral to create new blocks. In return, they earn inflationary rewards and transaction fees.\n\nBeyond reducing energy consumption and increasing throughput, the shift to PoS also expands participation in the consensus process. However, most PoS networks still have high barriers to entry and opportunity costs for prospective stakers. Large minimum capital (stake) requirements, technical complexity around the validation process, and extended lockup periods stand in the way of their ability and willingness to stake.\n\nAs a result, an entire industry called <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/what-s-at-stake-in-staking-as-a-service?referrer=author:chase-devens\">Staking-as-a-Service</a> has spawned to give tokenholders simple, flexible, and capital-efficient access to staking. The leader of this industry is Lido, a non-custodial, cross-chain liquid staking protocol. Lido abstracts away the challenges and risks around maintaining staking infrastructure by allowing users to delegate their assets, in any sum, to professional node operators. In return, stakers receive a tokenized derivative that represents their claim on the underlying stake pool and its yield. These liquid staking derivatives, known as Lido-staked assets (stAssets), can then be traded or used as collateral on a number of popular DeFi protocols.\n\nFor Ethereum, Solana, Kusama, Polygon, and Polkadot tokenholders, Lido is simultaneously opening up the opportunity to stake while reducing the opportunity cost of staking. Not only does this democratize access and create a more robust DeFi ecosystem, but it can also lead to more secure decentralized PoS networks as Lido progresses along in its roadmap.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Lido DAO was founded in 2020 by a group of prominent individuals and organizations including P2P Validator, ParaFi Capital, Stani Kulechov (Aave), and Twitter personality Jordan Fish (@cobie). The initial goal was to resolve some of the user experience issues in the Ethereum staking process, i.e., the significant upfront capital investment (32 ETH minimum), technical challenges around the validation process, and illiquid funds (locked until after The Merge).\n\nThe Lido liquid staking protocol launched a few weeks after the Beacon Chain in December 2020. After gaining traction, Lido went multi-chain, adding support for Terra (March 2021), Solana (September 2021), Kusama (February 2022), Polygon (March 2022), and Polkadot (June 2022). Recently, however, the Lido DAO voted against launching on the Terra reboot (Terra 2.0). Lido also continued to diversify its validator set by onboarding additional node operators through governance.\n\nHow Lido Works\n\nThe Lido DAO governs the five Lido liquid staking protocols. While each of the five supported PoS networks, Ethereum, Solana, Kusama, Polygon and Polkadot, have differences in design, the general mechanics around their liquid staking protocols are similar.\n\nHow Ethereum staking works on Lido. Source: @LeoGlisic, Messari\n\nThe two main parties involved are the users (stakers) and node operators (validators). The key protocol components are the staking smart contracts, the tokenized staking derivatives (stAssets), and the external DeFi integrations (e.g., Curve).\n\nNode Operators\n\nThe first critical component of a liquid staking protocol is its node operators because they are responsible for the actual staking. As of now, node operators are added and removed through the Lido DAO.\n\nThe whitelisting process starts with the Lido Node Operator Sub-Governance Group (LNOSG). The group currently consists of a representative from each of Lido’s twenty-one Ethereum node operators. Applications open up when Lido is launching on a new network or if LNOSG thinks a network can handle and benefit from additional node operators. The committee evaluates applicants based on several factors including reputation, past performance and the security, reliability, and novelty (uncorrelated nature) of their setup. Once LNOSG evaluates an applicant pool, it submits a list of recommended node operators to the Lido DAO for a tokenholder vote. A good validator set is critical for Lido since earnings and slashing penalties are socialized across all stakers in a given liquid staking protocol (e.g., all stETH holders).\n\nLido is also non-custodial, meaning node operators can’t directly access user funds. Instead, they must use a public validation key to validate transactions with staked assets. In order to align incentives, Lido node operators are compensated with a commission on the staking rewards generated from delegated funds.\n\nStaking Contracts\n\nUsers delegate stake to node operators through Lido’s smart contracts. The three main smart contracts are the NodeOperatorsRegistry, the staking pool, and the LidoOracle.\n\nLido Ethereum staking; under the hood. Source: The Lido Blog  \n\nThe NodeOperatorsRegistry holds the list of approved node operators.\n\nThe staking pool is the protocol’s central smart contract. Users interact with the staking pool by depositing and withdrawing their cryptoassets and minting/burning stAssets. The staking pool distributes the deposits uniformly (round-robin) to node operators using their addresses and validation keys. The staking pool contract is also responsible for distributing fees to the Lido DAO treasury and node operators.\n\nHow LidoOracle (“Oracle”) interacts with the staking pool on Ethereum. Source: The Lido Blog\n\nThe LidoOracle is responsible for keeping track of staking balances. The net staking reward, the difference between the staking yield and any slashing penalties, is tallied up daily and sent to the staking pool contract. The staking pool distributes 10% of the net staking reward by minting a proportional amount of the stAsset: 5% goes to node operators and 5% to the Lido DAO treasury. The remaining 90% of net staking rewards go to stAsset holders. Depending on the network, the rewards either show up as increases in the stAsset through its balance (via the rebasing mechanism) or its exchange rate.\n\nLido-staked Assets (stAssets)\n\nIn exchange for depositing assets into one of Lido’s liquid staking protocols, users receive a staking derivative (stAsset). This tokenized claim on the stake pool effectively unlocks the liquidity of staked assets while they continue to secure their respective networks and earn rewards. stAssets come in two different forms: rebase and shares.\n\nRebasing tokens (stETH, stKSM, stDOT) are minted at a 1:1 ratio with the deposit asset. In order to match the underlying stake, the token balance rebases every day to factor in accrued staking rewards. The daily rebase occurs regardless of where the stAsset is acquired; whether it’s directly from Lido, a decentralized exchange (DEX), or another holder.\n\nValue-accruing tokens (stSOL, stMATIC) earn staking rewards through appreciated value, reflected in the stAsset to deposit asset (e.g., stSOL:SOL) exchange rate. Rebase tokens can be converted to value-accruing tokens by being “wrapped.”\n\nAs of this writing, stETH accounts for over 98% of the value of stAssets in circulation. The stETH token is currently a purely synthetic, closed-end derivative since it can’t be directly redeemed for its underlying ETH until after The Merge. Instead, holders looking to convert their stETH to ETH rely on exchange (e.g., Curve, Uniswap, and FTX) pricing/liquidity.\n\nDeFi Integrations\n\nDEXs\n\nIn order to keep stETH liquid, the Lido DAO incentivizes the Curve stETH:ETH pool, currently the deepest AMM pool in DeFi. The Lido DAO token (LDO) and CRV incentives help attract liquidity by bolstering the pool’s APY. This pool, along with others like Uniswap and Balancer, gives stETH holders the ability to exit their staked positions for ETH before the unlock.\n\nThe price of 1 stETH should never really go above 1 ETH. This “ceiling” is in place because 1 ETH can always be used to mint 1 stETH through the Lido staking contract. However, the arbitrage mechanics aren’t as clear the other way around.\n\nSince stETH can’t be burned for its underlying ETH on the Lido protocol, the exchange rate currently relies on the market’s price discovery under the ceiling. A number of factors come into play for the current (and historical) discount including the fact that stETH has less liquidity, less utility (e.g., can’t be used to pay gas fees), and more technical (smart contract) risk than ETH. However, the stETH price does not usually dip very far below 1:1 with ETH because it then starts offering arbitrageurs an attractive discount at future (post-unlock) redemption value.\n\nEven for other stAssets, DEX liquidity is still useful because it gives holders the option to exit positions instantly, without having to wait through",

      "title": "$Push it (Real Good): Decentralized Notification Service in a Multichain World",
      "content": "Key Insights\n\nPush notifications are mostly absent in Web3 today, despite being a critical component of Web2.\nWeb3 organizations manage a scattershot of social media accounts to interact with their communities.\nEthereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) aims to solve this problem by offering a multichain, Web3 approach to push notifications and decentralized wallet-to-wallet communications.\nThe EPNS protocol incentivizes community engagement through its governance token PUSH and a network of delegates.\nThe company’s roadmap for 2022 dictates a rich set of features including multichain support and direct wallet-to-wallet communications.\n\nPush notifications are ubiquitous in digital life today, but in Web3’s current state, targeted push notifications are mostly absent. Instead, companies manage a scattershot collection of fragmented social media accounts to communicate with their users. When it comes to new feature sets, margin calls, governance votes, or even potential hacks, Web3 companies today find it difficult to simply reach their users. Ethereum Push Notification Service (EPNS) aims to solve this problem by offering a multichain, Web3 approach to push notifications and decentralized wallet-to-wallet communications. The project combats fragmented Web3 communications by enabling and incentivizing direct communications between decentralized services and users, without simultaneously compromising on features like user anonymity.\n\nIt’s hard to imagine a world without push notifications. First introduced to mobile via the Apple Push Notification Service in 2009, the average American now receives 45+ daily pinged notifications to a phone, browser, or tablet. Perhaps unsurprisingly, roughly 60% of users opt-out of receiving push notifications, allowing generally only the most critical pings from financial and utility applications.\n\nDecentralized and Web3 platforms, by nature of their permissionless-ness, neither receive nor store typical user data, like names, emails, or phone numbers, which is a feature rather than a bug. It’s meant to protect users from situations like a corporate data leak. Rather than permitting a company to store their data centrally, the Web3 user takes this responsibility and controls her own data, deciding when and whom to trust with that data. For companies seeking to engage and re-engage their users, though, the Web3 paradigm presents new challenges. Especially in a multichain world, where user activity spans tens or hundreds of applications across multiple blockchains, companies are finding it increasingly difficult to adequately communicate with and retain their users. On the user side, this is an equally challenging problem: interacting with multiple DeFi products requires users to constantly check metrics like liquidity margin, implied impermanent loss, or the sundowning of specific rewards programs. Look no further than the “close call” from January 2022, as MakerDAO vault owner “7 Siblings” narrowly missed a $600 million ETH liquidation.\n\nSource: EPNS\n\nEPNS is building a detailed roadmap to alleviate this exact pain point,, incentivizing both companies and users to opt-in rather than opt-out and solving for communications fragmentation and asynchronicity in a multichain world.\n\nEPNS: The Web3 Push Notification\n\nEPNS was founded in 2020 by Harsh Rajat and Richa Joshi, who together have over two decades of experience in founding and operating tech startups. Harsh and Richa are based in Mumbai, but the company employs a globally distributed team of over 30 people across development, product, and marketing. EPNS successfully closed a seed round in December 2020, raising $750 thousand at a $5 million valuation via a SAFT agreement, with participation from 25 angel investors and VCs, including Balaji Srinivasan, BlockRock Capital, LD Capital, and others. In March 2021, the company extended its SAFT offering to take on further investment, and raised $660 thousand from strategic and existing investors at a $12 million valuation. In April 2022, EPNS has announced a $10.1 million Series A funding round, with an average valuation of $131M. The round was led by Jump Crypto, with additional participation from Tiger Global, ParaFi, Sino Global Capital, Polygon Studios, DCX Ventures, Alpha Wave Capital, Zebpay, TRGC, Signum Capital, among others. The investment will be used to expand the team, grow the user base, and go multi-chain.\n\nIn the company’s own language, “EPNS is a protocol for blockchain-based notifications that are chain agnostic, platform independent and incentivized.” The protocol enables users (wallet addresses) to receive notifications and obtain token incentives through active participation. EPNS can be thought of as a wallet-to-wallet or service-to-wallet communications network, which enables pertinent off-chain events (e.g., Snapshot proposals) and on-chain information (e.g., block confirmations) to be transmitted to specific addresses (see this post on all the ways EPNS can integrate into DeFi). The protocol is a partially permission-based system, meaning all users – i.e., contract owners, channels, or users receiving notifications – must opt-in to receive or send notifications. EPNS maintains a public key registry of all opted-in users, which it considers non-invasive information because public keys are by nature publicly searchable. \n\nAny user can create what is called a channel. A channel exists to coordinate and send notifications to the channel’s subscribers. Each channel’s key information, such as description, organization website, and image, are input and stored as a JSON payload on IPFS. To successfully launch, each channel also requires a staked pool to fund its operations and incentivize subscribers. The protocol regulates the minimum and maximum $DAI deposit required to stake; currently, the staked pool requirement is minimum 50 $DAI with a cap of 250,000 $DAI. Each channel’s pool is directly deposited to Aave (or in the future, a similar open-source lending protocol). The yield from this deposit is distributed to channel subscribers based on a time-based distribution model. Deactivating a channel comes with a minimum 10 $DAI penalty, which is set to disincentivize users from spoofing channels. The penalty fee is ultimately deposited into a separate fee pool operated by the treasury. According to the company, the specifics around staking requirements are subject to change in future versions of the protocol, ultimately to be decided via governance vote.\n\nSource: EPNS\n\nEPNS envisions three types of channels: open, closed, and mutual. Open channels are open to all users without restriction and can indirectly subscribe users by paying them a small fee (e.g., CoinDesk). Closed channels cannot be freely subscribed to and instead pay subscribers to opt-in. Mutual channels require both parties to approve a user subscription. Once the channel is established, the EPNS protocol algorithmically maintains the appropriate incentives via its public registry by distributing staked tokens and adjusting spam ratings across its user base.\n\nEPNS operates two universal channels, “EPNS Channel'' and “EPNS Alerter Channel”, which are intended to only send out notifications of extreme importance to all its protocol users and channels. These notifications include for instance mainnet downtime, hacks, or similar events. For universal channels, users are required to opt-out if they wish to no longer receive protocol-wide notifications.\n\nEPNS takes spam into careful consideration, as mobile notifications have historically been overly exploited for retargeting and advertising. To combat spam at the protocol level, a rating is attributed to every channel based on time since launch, user growth, and unsubscribes due to spam. This rating is from 0 to 1 (1 = bad actor), with automatic notification throttling above a score of 0.8. The throttle mechanism is intended to systematically punish spam-like behavior at the channel-level. It is currently unclear exactly how the protocol will handle disputes around specific spam ratings.\n\nThough EPNS utilizes a semi-centralized infrastructure to provide its notification and message service to decentralized applications and users (see Whitepaper “Integration Flow”), the vision is to further decentralize its infrastructure over time. For instance, the company is researching the possibility of enabling a static EPNS file stored directly on IPFS that could point to a channel’s website hosted on IPFS. This could enable user-to-user communication, like hashed chat feeds and even decentralized video messaging. The following diagram shows how dApps and services can integrate with EPNS today.\n\nSource: EPNS Whitepaper\n\nFurther information for integrating services with EPNS can be found under the company’s smart contract documentation, which stipulates further criteria around the activation and deactivation of channels.\n\nEPNS is the simultaneous developer of five products on top of the EPNS protocol: EPNS Infra; a mobile application; a dApp; Showrunners; and a JavaScript (JS) Library. EPNS Infra is the name for the middleware which transmits data from decentralized protocols to centralized carriers like iOS, Android, and web browsers. The mobile application is the user interface (UI) for sending and receiving notifications at the user level, while the dApp enables decentralized carriers like Compound or Aave to also receive notifications. Showrunners are meant to be exemplar channels run directly by the EPNS team to show off the full capabilities of the protocol and drive interest. Showrunners include notifications for events like ENS domain expiry, Compound liquidation alerts, and gas fee idiosyncrasies. The JS Library is a product for integrating EPNS simply and efficiently into third-party apps.\n\nOn January 11, 2022, after more than a year of development, the EPNS protocol went live on the Ethereum mainnet, meaning the company’s suite of products are open for use.

      "title": "What's at Stake in Staking-as-a-Service?",
      "content": "The following report was written by Messari Hub Analyst(s) and commissioned by Blockdaemon, a member of<a href=\"https://messari.io/hub\"> Messari Hub</a>. For additional information, please see the disclaimers following the article.\n\nToday’s leading blockchains are undergoing a massive shift from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS) consensus mechanisms. The original PoW model pioneered by Satoshi Nakamoto has fallen out of favor as critics point to the negative externalities created by its security model and its trend towards centralized mining pools. In its place, PoS designs are witnessing tremendous growth for their promises of energy efficiency and greater decentralization. If the Ethereum 2.0 (Eth2) “merge” to PoS were finalized today, PoS based chains would account for 44% of Layer 1 market capitalization. If we ignored Bitcoin from that calculation, PoS chains would balloon to a 91% share. This shift away from PoW dominated networks is already creating second-order effects in the form of new business models that earn rewards for securing PoS networks.\n\nSince the inception of Bitcoin in 2008, PoW chains have enabled companies to build business models centered around maximizing mining rewards. Early mining companies understood they would benefit from economies of scale and began establishing “server farms” in locations with cheap energy costs to maximize their probability to earn mining rewards. In just 13 years, crypto mining has swelled into a roughly $31 billion industry. PoS chains open up similar business opportunities for individuals and companies that seek to capitalize on PoS rewards. JP Morgan estimates that staking already generates $9 billion worth of revenue annually and will grow into a $40 billion industry by 2025. Given this lucrative forecast, it’s essential to understand the nuances of staking and how they interplay with the rising staking-as-a-service industry (STaaS).\n\n* To avoid confusion with the established SaaS acronym within the tech industry (software-as-a-service), we will refer to staking-as-a-service as STaaS for the remainder of this report.\n\nA Background on Proof of Stake\n\nFor a permissionless blockchain to function, only one entity may update the network’s shared ledger at any given time. A consensus mechanism is the set of rules that the security providers within a blockchain network use to determine which participant’s update should be adopted by the network. The entity responsible for inputting a series of transactions (block) at any time is known as the block producer. In return for producing a new block and thereby upholding the network’s security, the block producer earns block rewards from the network (the composition of block rewards will be explored in greater detail below).\n\nAs mentioned above, PoW and PoS are two of the most widely used consensus engines powering today’s blockchains. In a PoW system, “miners” expend physical resources (time and energy) in a competition to become the next block producer. This burning of external resources gives the network its sense of security. Should a bad actor wish to halt or alter the state of the network, they would need to control   50% of the network’s computing power.\n\nIn a PoS system, the competition for exogenous, physical resources (power), is replaced by the competition to attract the native cryptocurrency. This endogenous resource is known as stake.This key difference allows PoS networks to operate without expending large amounts of electricity and allows for wider participation in the consensus process compared to PoW. Participants that wish to become a network validator must stake, or lock up, a portion of the network’s native cryptocurrency as a pledge to contribute to the consensus process in good faith. The value of the network’s total stake is what provides it with security, which makes different forms of 51% attacks more expensive than PoW - as Vlad Zamfir said “it’s as though your ASIC farm burned down if you mined an invalid block”.\n\nAside from its primary function as a security barrier, a validator’s stake is important for two additional reasons. First, a validator’s stake amount is directly proportional to its probability of being elected to input new transactions to the ledger, thereby influencing the amount of rewards earned by the validator. A validator’s stake also serves as collateral to disincentivize adverse behaviors. Should a validator act maliciously towards the network, it will generally be penalized by losing a portion of its stake or losing the right to participate in the consensus process for a period of time. Together, this system incentivizes healthy network behavior. Validators stake more collateral for a greater proportion of block rewards. The greater the amount of collateral staked, the more likely validators will perform to network norms, thereby ensuring chain security.\n\nThe Rise of STaaS\n\nThe Incentive to Stake\n\nWith this basic technical understanding of how PoS consensus functions, we can explore the economic opportunities it creates. A PoS network incentivizes stakers to contribute to its security by rewarding validators with block rewards composed of network inflation and transaction fees. The inflationary rewards can be thought of as the network’s native incentive to encourage users to put their assets to work. Those that choose to hold rather than stake will be subject to dilution in networks with inflationary supply schedules. Should 100% of the network stake, there would be no relative change in network ownership as all of the inflationary rewards would be distributed to all existing holders. This is very unlikely to ever happen considering it would mean that no one is actually running applications on the network or making transactions. Therefore, each PoS network exhibits different active staking rates depending on the activity and incentives at play within each respective network.\n\nThe ever-changing staking rate results in a dynamic reward rate for a network’s stakers. As more stake enters the network, the active rewards rate decreases as staking rewards must be distributed to a larger group and vice versa. This overall staking return is known as the nominal staking rate, which includes transaction fees and inflation. The nominal rewards rate less the amount of rewards attributed to overall network inflation is referred to as the real rate. While the nominal yields for many PoS chains can reach double digits, the real rate typically ends up in the single digits at current levels. The main exception to this trend is Binance Smart Chain (BSC), where block rewards are composed entirely of transaction fees.\n\nObstacles Create Opportunities\n\nIf staking is the native revenue channel for participants in a PoS network, why doesn’t everyone run a validator? There are several factors at play here. First, there is generally a minimum capital requirement to become a validator which ends up pricing out the majority of retail users.\n\nEven chains like Solana that have no minimum stake requirement still demand capital in other forms such as high-end computers, voting fees (currently estimated at 2 SOL per day or ~$500), and sufficient capital staked for the validator to be elected. If a participant has enough capital to meet the minimum stake threshold, they are tasked with the ongoing chore of ensuring their validator is always online and performing correctly. Most PoS networks will punish offline or misbehaving validators using slashing penalties. Finally, staking comes with an opportunity cost - assets are locked up for a period of time and can’t be used for other purposes such as borrowing and lending in DeFi. This problem applies to most PoS networks that use a bonded staking mechanism but are avoided in networks such as Cardano that support native liquid staking. Altogether, these problems are exactly what the STaaS industry aims to solve for its users.\n\nThe STaaS industry was originally created to offer the economic benefits of staking to the masses while solving the challenge of ongoing validator maintenance for non-technical users. As the industry has matured, we’ve begun to see the addition of liquid staking derivatives to help offset the opportunity cost of locking up staked assets. STaaS is a relatively straightforward business model - users transfer or delegate their assets to a STaaS provider that manages a set of validators. This allows even the smallest of users to enjoy the benefits of staking. By using a STaaS provider, a user can easily stake almost any PoS asset in a few clicks.\n\nIn return for maintaining the necessary validator services for its customers, a STaaS provider will charge its customers a fee. This can be a fixed fee per month but is more commonly a percentage of the rewards generated on its customers’ stake. Such commissions generally range from 5 - 20% of customers’ staking rewards. Over time, we can expect fee percentages to grind lower as a result of more competition from a growing population of staking providers joining the ecosystems. Additionally, the nominal amount of fees generated per customer is expected to decline as protocols mature and taper their rewards schedule.\n\nSTaaS Categorization\n\nSimilar to today’s wallet and exchange offerings, we can classify today’s STaaS businesses as either custodial or non-custodial. Regardless of these classifications, all STaaS may offer a liquid staking feature.\n\nCustodial STaaS\n\nCustodial STaaS providers are characterized by taking control of and maintaining customers’ assets throughout the entire staking process. The most common examples of centralized staking providers are centralized exchanges such as Coinbase or Kraken.\n\nSource: Coinbase\n\nCustodial STaaS is generally targeted towards retail users that want a simple way to earn a return on their holdings without worrying about the backend processes. Any rewards generated on customers’ stake is distributed first to the staking provider before being pass",

      "content": "Data is just a story waiting to be told.\n\nOne aspect about data that I love is that it can tell stories of the past, the present, and opens the mind to the potential stories of the future.\n\nLet’s start with the past.\n\nThe Past: Context For the Present\n\nWhile non-fungible tokens have existed for a long time, the market for such tokens was historically small. Early marketplaces like OpenSea and SuperRare, which were founded in 2017, grinded through a market that was mostly dominated by Ethereum until blockchains like WAX and Flow finally launched offering application-specific chains for gaming and consumer applications. In 2020, OpenSea was <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/opensea-surpasses-20-000-users-unofficially-claims-the-title-the-uniswap-of-nfts\">averaging</a> $1 million in sales per month and the tailend of the first Covid-19 year experienced growth (now considered a kindling fire) in NFT art and collectibles sales.\n\nDecember of 2020 witnessed some uptick NFT chatter with the <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/fantasy-sports-crypto-s-next-consumer-application?utmsource=MasonNystrom&utmmedium=ledetweet&utm_campaign=fantasysports\">growing excitement</a> of NBA Top Shots and early Ethereum card games like Axie Infinity and Sorare.\n\nWhat comes next, you may already know, but let's break it down by the data anyway.\n\nThe Past: 2021\n\nThe first NFT narrative to explode at the beginning of the year (as a continuation of 2020) was sports NFTs, specifically NBA Top Shot.\n\nCombining financial incentives with sports is a tried and true recipe and cryptonetworks with tokenized digital goods are the natural steroids for which the industry will use to reach new heights.\n\nIn tandem with the breakout of sports NFTs, 2021 will go down perhaps most significantly as the year of the digital renaissance. As the mainstream media watched the birth of new business models and monetization strategies, platforms like Nifty Gateway and SuperRare dominated, offering artists a new format for monetizing their work.\n\nNFT royalties are easily a 10x improvement from the legacy artist monetization system and nearly every artist's endeavor is examining how to issue NFTs. The joy of digital painting continues into the summer as new platforms like Art Blocks and Foundation onboard new artists and collectors.\n\nThe NFT summer moment largely becomes overshadowed with the continued growth of pfp/avatar projects and Axie Infinity’s Ronin launch, which immediately experiences rapid growth in users and NFT secondary sales.\n\nThe final leg of our saga gets told through the lens of Solana. With Ethereum experiencing heightened gas prices, pfp creation and flipping, in part, moves to <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/layer-1-of-the-rising-sun-solana-nfts\">Solana</a> which quickly marches towards surpassing Flow in Cumulative NFT volume.\n\nIn hindsight, August of 2021 was the peak with over $4.5 billion in NFT secondary sales, likely more when factoring in art sales and non Cryptoslam tracked NFTs (e.g digital land).\n\nThe present has a funny way of misshaping our view of the past. Although the past few months still lagged compared to the peak, it’s worthwhile to realize that the NFT secondary market is still multiples stronger than where it was at the beginning of the year. In early January, $50 million in NFT sales was a massive achievement. Now, $50 million in NFT sales is a bad day for OpenSea.\n\nInevitable NFT Multichain Future\n\nThe NFT market has officially surpassed $15 billion in secondary sales combined across a variety of categories including gaming, PFPs (profile pics), virtual worlds, sports, and collectibles. More importantly, while Ethereum leads, the future is growing more multichain by the day.\n\nSeveral blockchains are developing robust ecosystems for consumer applications, built on the foundation of digital ownership enabled by NFTs. The burgeoning NFT multichain future is rapidly approaching. Three Layer-1 blockchains possess secondary volumes of nearly $1 billion (Ethereum, Flow, Solana) and Ethereum leads all blockchains and Layer-2s with nearly $10 billion in secondary NFT sales.\n\nWhile much of the NFT market is inherently financial, the growth of all digital goods and services requires initial capital investment and the public nature of crypto makes capital readily available for individuals, creators, and developers who are willing to build unique NFT protocols and products.\n\nMost of the NFT categories that witnessed explosive sales growth this year can be described as cultural NFTs – art, collectibles, sports, pfp/avatars, and more. As the world moves onto permissionless blockchains and tokenizes everything that can be tokenized, investing will become more democratized and naturally expand to hobbies including art, music, fashion, content, and more. The dawn of culture investing has only begun.\n\nOver the past twelve months, the NFT landscape emerged from a small ecosystem with a few hundred million in sales volume to a multichain ecosystem amassing billions in capital. When you examine the data of NFTs, it unpacks a robust story of wealth, human achievement, and cultural wonder. Ultimately, the data can only tell the story until now, and while it gives us useful insight into how the future unfolds, what comes next you must imagine.  \n  \nMessari 2022 Theses - Heroes and Battlefields NFTs\n\nA partnership between artist Jaen and Messari featuring an ultra-limited collection of NFT’s celebrating the fifth annual release of the Messari Theses for 2022.\n\nMessari’s Theses for 2022 takes a deep dive into crypto’s industry leaders, major trends, projects, themes and topics.

NBA Top Shot accounts for the majority of sports NFT sales and remains one of the most successful NFT applications overall. Over time, sports like Soccer – and the NFTs projects behind those sports like Sorare – boast larger potential markets.\n\nThese projects rely highly on partnerships and licensing agreements with professional sports organizations to use the image and likeness of athletes and sports teams. Notably, Zed Run – a digital horse racing game where NFTs represent individual horses – announced a partnership with NASCAR to develop a stock car auto racing game to grow a new fandom experience. As the companies – Dapper Labs (NBA Top Shot), Sorare, Virtual Human Studio (Zed Run) – grow their signature NFT brands, they will continue to evolve by expanding to other sports or building applications on top of their games (e.g. NBA Top Shot is developing a fantasy game called HardCourt).\n\nWhile total monthly sales have declined, Sorare and Zed Run have remained steady showing continued interest for NFT in sports-based applications. It’s possible that the functionality offered by Sorare and Zed Run NFTs – both are used for fantasy sports or racing – has resulted in their continued speculation while sole collectibles like Top Shot and Topps NFTs have experienced a decline in speculative fervor.\n\nBut, even though volume for NBA Top Shot slows, unique buyers have remained relatively strong with over 50,000 unique buyers each month since February. Following the NFT market peak, Topps MLB and F1 Delta Time have fallen behind in user growth and sales compared to Sorare, Zed Run, and NBA Top Shot.\n\nStill, crypto sports applications present one of the most obvious use cases for passionate fans to speculate on their favorite activities or transfer their gambling habits – like horse racing – from the physical realm into the digital.\n\nSports are a passion shared by billions of people around the world. Crypto sports don’t promise the same level of national pride, human achievement, and raw emotion that we witness in the Olympics. However, crypto sports apps will be widely integrated into our daily lives as individuals continue to search for ways to speculate on their passions.",

      "title": "Q2'21 Layer-1 Review: A Peek at the Largest Ecosystems by TVL",
      "content": "Q1 2021 marked the beginning of the <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/q1-2021-layer1-review-the-scaling-wars-have-arrived\">long-awaited ecosystem wars</a>. With crypto markets continuing to attract mainstream attention, newfound retail entrants pushed Ethereum’s fees to all-time highs. The surge in demand was a net positive for the industry but rendered Ethereum unusable for most retail users, prompting them to look for alternative options since the beginning of the year. In conjunction with the deployment of <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/ecosystem-of-ethereum-scaling-solutions\">scaling solutions</a> and the growth of the application ecosystems on adjacent Layer-1s like Binance Smart Chain (BSC), this exodus has become an important factor affecting Ethereum’s dominance in the space.\n\nQ2 2021 picked up where the previous quarter left off. The TVL flows over the last three months prove that Ethereum is still the belle of the ball, but it may not be the only party worth attending.\n\nTVL to the Moon\n\nIn a relatively short period of time, total value locked (TVL) in smart contracts went parabolic. Since October 2020, a mere seven months ago, assets flowing in different smart contract platforms increased tenfold from $10 billion (almost all locked in Ethereum) to over $100 billion across several scaling solutions and Layer-1s. The growth is nothing short of extraordinary.\n\nWhile TVL growth is a strong indication of increasing user confidence and activity in DeFi protocols, it needs to be taken with a grain of salt. The metric is computed based on the USD denominated value of the tokens locked in smart contracts, so in many cases, an increase in TVL doesn’t necessarily mean more tokens are being deposited. An appreciation in token price is also a determining factor. Despite this shortcoming, TVL can be a useful statistic to compare the growth and adoption of different smart contract platforms since it provides a simple apples-to-apples comparison.\n\nThe Dawn of the “Ethereum Killer”\n\nAlthough the growth of the Layer-1 and Layer-2 sectors could ultimately benefit Ethereum, its dominance in the space is beginning to shrink. Of the $110 billion dollars in TVL, Ethereum controls roughly 77%, a drop of more than 20% when compared to its dominance five months ago.\n\nDespite the recent decline, Ethereum remains home to the most vibrant DeFi and NFT ecosystems. Since October of last year, TVL has ballooned from $11 billion to $85 billion (a 631% increase) as the yield-farming craze infected the crypto markets. The movement, catalyzed by Compound, acted as a propellant for the space as crypto users put more and more assets to work in various DeFi applications.\n\nAs a result, Ethereum’s DeFi sector has been the dominant destination for user funds. As of July 5th, roughly 47% of TVL is in six major DeFi protocols: Curve, Aave, MarkerDAO, Compound, Yearn, Uniswap, and SushiSwap. The other 53% is distributed across the remaining 169 applications tracked by DeFi Llama.\n\nBack in October 2020, TVL was mostly concentrated in Uniswap and MakerDAO, which accounted for approximately 43% of the value locked in Ethereum. However, the explosion of new financial primitives that began during DeFi Summer 2020 has whittled away at their dominance as investors moved assets searching for the next hot farming opportunity. This trend has continued throughout 2021, with long-tail applications now housing almost half of all TVL.\n\nThe Binance Rollercoaster\n\nIn the end, Ethereum’s success also became its burden.\n\nThe effects of Ethereum’s rising transaction fees started appearing in the first few months of 2021. Ethereum’s dominance began to decline as developers and users began to look for cheaper alternatives outside of the most popular blockchain. The first Ethereum challenger that began to experience meaningful traction as a result of Ethereum’s fee environment was Binance Smart Chain (BSC).\n\nPropelled by a $100 million support fund and backed by the largest exchange in the world, BSC began to quickly expand its DeFi ecosystem, which featured direct copies of successful Ethereum-based applications. BSC’s <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/binance-enters-the-smart-contract-wars\">proximity to Ethereum</a> in terms of building tools made it easy for developers to quickly iterate and deploy applications. On the user side, BSC’s compatibility with MetaMask lowered the barrier to entry for many Ethereum-native users creating a seamless transition between the two chains. These two catalysts in conjunction with extremely high token incentives led to a large influx of new users who sought cheap yield farming.\n\nBy the beginning of May 2021, BSC managed to capture $15 billion in total assets or approximately 13% of Ethereum’s TVL. PancakeSwap (DEX) and Venus (lending platform) are currently the two most successful applications and the ones that captured the highest amount of assets in the early days of 2021.\n\nBSC’s TVL has been quite the rollercoaster ride in Q2 2021. Soon after crossing the $15 billion mark, its TVL more than doubled to $35 billion in the span of ten days due to a wild price upswing for BNB and its spawn (like <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/pancakeswap\">CAKE</a> and <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/venus\">XVS</a>). But the euphoria generated by the new all-time highs quickly vanished as a series of <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/weekly-recap-ending-may-20th?referrer=category:all-research\">negative catalysts</a> hit the market in mid-May, including a liquidation incident on Venus that lost $200 million and a flash loan attack on Pancake Bunny worth $45 million. The rise in exploits drained user confidence and sent token prices and TVL tumbling.\n\nAlthough TVL across all smart contract platforms contracted, BSC’s was particularly hurt given most of the value locked in its applications was mercenary capital and consisted of assets that had little use outside of incentivizing users. Unlike Ethereum's TVL, which has a healthy dose of stablecoins in the mix, the composition of BSC’s TVL was heavily skewed towards the higher end of the risk spectrum, making it extremely sensitive to market swings.\n\nAs mentioned above, in the early days of Binance Smart Chain, TVL was concentrated in two of its most successful applications: PancakeSwap and Venus. In October 2020, PancakeSwap was the leading application accounting for 60-70% of all the money flowing in the platform. The dynamic quickly changed when Venus entered the market in December 2020. The lending platform rapidly captured a significant portion of TVL cementing itself as the second-largest DeFi protocol in the BSC ecosystem.\n\nFrom December 2020 to April 2021, both protocols controlled around 90% of all the assets in the platform. In mid-April, as newer protocols launched, TVL began to spread out to other protocols like MDEX, Ellipsis Finance, and Wault. However, as of July 5th, PancakeSwap and Venus regained their dominant positions within the BSC ecosystem, controlling over 65% of the funds locked in smart contracts.\n\nPolygon’s Rise to Fame\n\nThe second platform that started chipping away at Ethereum’s TVL in April of 2021 was Layer-2 solution Polygon. Like BSC, Polygon took advantage of Ethereum’s high fee environment to bootstrap its application ecosystem by offering lower fees and faster transaction times. Polygon’s biggest advantage to date has been its compatibility with Ethereum, which lowered the learning curve for both users and developers. It is currently the third-largest chain in terms of TVL, handling 5% of all assets locked across all platforms.\n\nPolygon’s TVL went from less than $50 million to over $5 billion in Q2. This explosive growth was the result of two distinct factors. The first was the deployment of DeFi majors Aave, SushiSwap, and Curve. The protocols began exploring the scalability capabilities of Polygon at the beginning of Q2 2021 in an attempt to work around Ethereum’s congestion. Given their popularity and strong communities, it’s no surprise that the migration led to an uptick in user acquisition.\n\nThe second reason for the nearly exponential growth was the launch of Polygon’s DeFiforAll Fund. The team committed up to 2% of <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/polygon\">MATIC</a>’s total supply to continuously support the growth of its DeFi ecosystem over the next two to three years in the form of liquidity mining rewards across different applications. Unsurprisingly, the lion’s share of the rewards is currently going to users of the top DeFi applications in the ecosystem including Aave, Curve, and SushiSwap.\n\nAs a result, these three protocols account for nearly 65% of all value locked in Polygon. In particular, Aave’s market share of TVL exploded, going from less than 10% to 70% almost instantly due to its liquidity mining program.\n\nToken-incentivized user growth has become one of the most popular strategies used by protocols to bootstrap a community. This strategy, while efficient in the short term, can sometimes prove detrimental if it is not managed carefully. In many cases, the higher yields end up attracting mercenary capital from users who are looking to make a quick buck but have no vested interest in the long-term success of the project. In this kind of scenario, protocols are able to garner millions of dollars only to see it vanish when token incentives stop.\n\nWhile it might be too early to tell, this kind of user behavior is manifesting in Polygon’s largest applications. The three DeFi giants that account for more than $3 billion dollars of TVL are starting to see capital migrate back to Ethereum. In the case of Aave, which is the protocol offering the highest amount of liquidity mining incentives, it reached a point where TVL between Ethereum and Polygon was split 70% and 30% respectively. However, over the past two weeks, roughly 10% of Aave’s total TVL has made its way back to Ethereum.\n\nSushiSwap followed a similar pattern. TVL in Polygon ",

      "title": "2Q'21 Currency Sector Recap",
      "content": "The 2Q’21 was a tale of two halves in one of the most eventful quarters of the Currency sector’s history.\n\nThe first half of the quarter was full of jubilations as Coinbase (COIN) employees popped champagne during the company's direct listing on April 14, 2021. Bitcoin reached all time highs (ATHs) of over $60,000, and there were more eyes on crypto than ever before. Institutional investors and banks moved to announce their involvement in the digital assets sphere, pouring equity capital and launching new initiatives to get their clients onboard. Even State Street, the second oldest bank in the US with $3.1 trillion in assets under management, announced it will be building a crypto trading platform.\n\nWe also saw speculative mania of DOGE reaching <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/dogecoin\">$0.74</a> on the back of Elon posing as the Dogefather on Saturday Night Live (SNL). ASS, SHIBA and CUMMIES also saw the limelight, though meme coins rarely warrant mainstream media attention. Mark Zuckerberg even announced the names of his two goats, Max and Bitcoin, perhaps hinting to the world that he’s a Bitcoin maximalist.\n\nBitcoin 2Q’21\n\nWhile Bitcoin’s price rallied +10% in the first part of April, its price ended the month down by -9%. The sudden drop in value should’ve raised a few red flags but markets ignored warning signs of a major reversal or market fatigue since Bitcoin had seen six consecutive positive months, a first since 2012. In retrospect, there were indeed signs of market fatigue. The COIN direct listing saw the price collapse by -20% in the first days of trading, and Tesla also announced it had sold 10% of their Bitcoin position for treasury management reasons. Nevertheless, all indications still pointed to a bull run as the remainder of the crypto market diverged from Bitcoin’s price performance. In April, <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\">ETH</a> was up +44%, DOGE continued its winning streak up +463%, and even late-cycle <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum-classic\">ETC</a> was up 146%.\n\nIn mid-May, Bitcoin’s price began to reverse seeing the largest reversal as its third-worst performing month in history, down -38%. This finally ended narratives that this rally was just like the 2017 bull market.\n\nIt wasn’t even like the 2013 bull market either, as investors found themselves in uncharted waters. Never before had a four-year cyclical top been so tame and never before had a mid-bull run reversal been so severe.\n\nThe month of May also brought an onslaught of sequential negative news events in a FUD (fear, uncertainty, and doubt) bath. Market participants began to wonder if this attack on Bitcoin was coordinated. Negative news included Tesla ceasing to accept Bitcoin for purchases, citing Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) concerns. This resulted in mainstream media frequently reporting on Bitcoin’s coal usage and impact on global warming. Even the Pope commented on the detriments of technology based on “highly polluting fossil fuels”. Most importantly, Tesla’s announcement sparked Elon Musk’s damaging verbal diarrhea on Bitcoin, even after agreeing that Bitcoin incentivizes renewable energy.\n\nSource: Travis Kling\n\nMany valid ESG rebuttals (here, here, here, and here) were provided but were largely ignored by mainstream media. Michael Saylor even championed a North American Bitcoin Mining Council to collect renewable usage data. As soon as it seemed that Bitcoin was heading in the right direction with ESG, the public outcry ceased by mid-June, as quickly as it started. The Bitcoin ESG FUD would be shelved for another day. For Q2’21, the Bitcoin Mining Council reported that the Bitcoin Mining energy usage only amounted to 0.12% of the World’s total energy consumption.\n\nSource: Bitcoin Mining Council\n\nIn the US, the sector also saw one of the busiest months of regulatory headwinds. The US Senate Banking Committee urged the new Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) Head to review past favorable crypto rulings and the OCC, FDIC and the Fed was reportedly in talks about an interagency crypto policy team. The FDIC, in its capacity as a federal banking regulator, was issuing requests for information from banks on crypto usage. The IRS was reportedly cracking down on crypto tax evasion. The IRS was also, along with the US Justice Department, investigating the world’s largest exchange, Binance. Additionally, New York State introduced a Senate Bill to halt Bitcoin mining for three years while it assessed the environmental impact. The Treasury called for crypto transfers above $10,000 to be reported to the IRS. Secretary of the Treasury Janet Yellen called the US crypto regulatory framework inadequate and pushed for a new framework and SEC Chair Gary Gensler stated greater investor protection is needed on crypto exchanges. Most damaging of all could have been the slew of fake news and unsubstantiated claims.\n\nSeparately, growing institutional adoption of Bitcoin could have meant that <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/macro-update-on-bubbles-taper-tantrums\">macroeconomics played a role</a> in this selldown. On May 12 2021, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) printed +4.2%,the highest inflation print since September 2008. In light of signs of overheating in the market, though mitigated by bad jobs numbers, the Fed’s meeting minutes hinted that they were beginning to think about, thinking about tapering. This led to a knee jerk reaction of US real yields rising +9bps though traditional financial markets remained relatively calm. Markets already knew that inflation numbers were high due to a low base effect from COVID-19. However, Bitcoin, at the extreme end of the risk curve for traditional institutional investors, saw a major selldown. The month after, the CPI print of 5% was even higher but it didn’t warrant a market reaction. As expected, the Fed will patiently wait for economic data to decide if they will bring forth tapering from the expected Q1’22E. Concerns of tapering subsided, but Bitcoin’s price failed to recover.\n\nIn China, the Vice Premier Liu announced a crackdown specifically on crypto mining and trading. It was nothing new -- China had banned securities companies from engaging in Bitcoin since 2013, and also banned trading in 2017. However, never before had the announcement come from someone so senior in the China Communist Party, the chair of the State Council’s Financial Stability and Development Committee. And never before had Bitcoin mining and trading been specifically stated. The government newspaper, Xinhua, also published articles citing a series of crypto-related scams, with 1,100 people arrested for money laundering through crypto. Reasons cited by the public focus on social stability, especially important before the Communist Party’s 100th anniversary on July 1.\n\nThis resulted in Chinese search engine Baidu removing Binance, Huobi and OKEx. Weibo, a prominent social media platform, blocked major exchanges and key opinion leaders. <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/bitcoin\">BTC </a>market data was also removed from security trading platforms like Tencent-backed Futu and Tiger Securities. Additionally, companies highlighted that their plans to launch crypto trading services would target non-China domiciled clients. Major crypto exchanges Huobi and OKEx scaled back on leveraged trading, from a maximum of 125x to less than 5x. Furthermore, new clients wouldn’t have access to the leverage trading function.\n\nSource: WuBlockchain\n\nOn the mining front, the Inner Mongolia region was the first to comply, followed by more important regions such as Xinjian, the most important mining region during the dry season. As miners packed up, the total hash rate, an indicator of the computing power in the network, halved from mid May to the end of the quarter. While Bitcoin’s hash rate has not recovered yet from the largest sustained percentage decline, perhaps the worst is already behind us in terms of the impact of China’s crackdown on Bitcoin mining. We expect hash rate to recover over the course of the year, as miners find other venues of electricity and restart their operations. Many of the miners from Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Sichuan are reportedly moving to various locations including Kazakhstan, Texas and Norway.\n\nJust as suddenly as the noise around environmental concerns rapidly died off towards the end of June -- so did concerns of China’s mining shutdown. Overall, these are net long-term positives for Bitcoin as what doesn’t kill it only makes it stronger. Indeed, as the world becomes more environmentally friendly and no institutional investors want to run afoul of the ESG movement, Bitcoin will need to pivot towards renewable energy to gain global adoption. Also, false narratives that Bitcoin is a “Chinese financial weapon” or that Bitcoin is a threat to US national security -- the code is literally open sourced -- can finally be put to bed as mining hashpower will more evenly be distributed throughout the world.\n\nTowards the end of the quarter, El Salvador became the first country in the world to adopt Bitcoin as legal tender in an effort to de-dollarize and reduce the cost of remittances. The government also announced a $30 airdrop for all adults through its own digital wallet. While Bitcoin’s global penetration is ~2%, El Salvador’s Chamber of Commerce’s data indicates that 21-25% of the population would use BTC. While there was no meaningful impact on Bitcoin’s price, it was a global step towards wider adoption. Furthermore, it could be the first of several countries to adopt Bitcoin as Paraguay also announced a bill that would make Bitcoin legal tender.\n\nSource: Steve Hanke\n\nBitcoin Markets\n\nIn terms of markets, derivatives were punished this quarter. Markets started strong, with ETH touching $3,000 on May 3 only to have $246 million of open interest in the ETH call $5,000 strike the day after. However, by the end of the quarter, given the wate",

      "content": "Week In Review\n\nThe NEAR Foundation <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/796103c8-d77c-4408-a7d2-11c60048bfa7?utmsource=newsletter&utmmedium=newsletter&utmcampaign=intel-near-ecosystem-treasury\">submitted</a> a proposal on Jun. 16, 2021, to establish an Ecosystem Treasury DAO.\nThe Harmony team has <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/515adfc1-564a-4db6-8b2f-f89de0a80eb1?utmsource=newsletter&utmmedium=newsletter&utmcampaign=intel-harmony-v418\">updated</a> the release notes for v4.1.8 of its mainnet client.\nThe proposal to <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/8ba1e84e-ace3-475e-9e2e-a2108fd7898e?utmsource=newsletter&utmmedium=newsletter&utmcampaign=intel-mirror-v2-passed\">approve</a> Mirror V2 has passed.\nThe current Granada proposal has <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/d1efc43d-6c1b-4a82-90ba-7f7a06a008d2?utmsource=newsletter&utmmedium=newsletter&utmcampaign=intel-granada-exploration\">passed</a> the Exploration Phase, which ended on Jun. 23, 2021.\n\nSector Performance Overview\n\nLast week was a bloodbath in crypto markets. According to Messari’s <a href=\"https://messari.io/screener/all-assets-D86E0735\">sector convention</a>, all sectors ended the week with double-digit losses. The least affected sector was Currencies which ended the week with a 12% loss aided by Bitcoin’s resilience to the continued market drop as a result of investors moving down the risk curve to less volatile assets.\n\nHigh beta sectors such as Decentralized Exchange and DeFi suffered the most during the week. The DeFi sector was hurt by the weekly performance of Uniswap (-20.9%), Aave (-30.16%), and MakerDAO (-24.15%). Similarly, the DEX sector was dragged down by Uniswap, PancakeSwap (-15.93%), THORChain (-30.52%), and SushiSwap (-17.99%).\n\nSector Portfolio Weights\n\nThe sector portfolio weights for this week’s report are as follows. The portfolio allocations are constructed following the market capitalization methodology using data as of June 24th.\n\nSector Drill Down\n\nPerformance during the week ending on June 24th was brutal across cryptocurrency markets. China’s expanding crackdown on Bitcoin mining was the main catalyst for this week’s crash. On Monday, China summoned several major banks and payment companies to impose tougher actions over the trading of cryptocurrencies. Institutions were told not to provide products or services that include trading, clearing, or settlement of cryptocurrency transactions which ultimately led to a widespread bearish sentiment across the broader market. As a result, all sectors experienced heavy losses early on in the week with Bitcoin dipping below $30,000 for the first time in more than five months. The market shock was more drastic for risker tokens (primarily in the DeFi, DEX, and Web3 sectors). Losses across high beta tokens ranged from 20-30% over the past 7 days.\n\nSimilar to the sector performance, the Currency portfolio suffered the least losses during the week. The portfolio’s relatively high allocation to Bitcoin, which finished the week with only a 10% loss, was the reason for the outperformance of the Currency portfolio relative to other sector portfolios potentially signaling that appetite for risk is nowhere to be found.\n\nThe rotation from a risk-on to a risk-off environment can be better visualized by the recent bump in Bitcoin’s dominance. Since the market top in mid-May, Bitcoin’s dominance increased approximately 10% as investors pivot towards low volatility assets.\n\nFollowing the same pattern as last week, the DEX and DeFi portfolio suffered the most losses ending the week with a -23% return. In both cases, Uniswap was the main driver of performance given its high allocation in the portfolios.\n\nOver the past two weeks, volatility, defined as the rolling standard deviation of daily log returns, reverted back to normal levels after experiencing a massive spike due to the market turbulence in May. However, portfolio volatility is starting to creep up once again as uncertainty about market conditions continues to mount.\n\nSimilar to last week, the DEX, DeFi, and Web3 portfolios experienced the highest increase in volatility during the week going from 5-6% to 10-11% in the span of three days. The Bitcoin-heavy portfolios (Top Assets and Currency portfolios) only saw a 2% bump over the same period of time.\n\nIn terms of correlation with Bitcoin, sector portfolios continue to see a decline week-over-week. As mentioned earlier, this behavior is due to Bitcoin’s outperformance relative to the broader market.\n\nSimilarly, the correlation with Ethereum is also seeing a slight decline this week but not as noticeable as with Bitcoin. Notably, the Currency portfolio (which has an allocation of 88% to Bitcoin) has seen the biggest decline as the correlation between Ethereum and Bitcoin trends lower.\n\n",

Following Messari’s sector convention, the Currency sector outperformed the rest ending the week with a 4.7% return. The sector benefited from Bitcoin’s 7-day performance (4.5% weekly return) which was one of the top-performing assets from the group of tokens covered in this report.\n\nDeFi and Web3 also ended the week with positive returns. On the positive side, Venus (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/venus\">XVS</a>), 1inch (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/1inch\">1INCH</a>), and BarnBridge (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/barnbridge\">BOND</a>) pushed the DeFi sector up while Alchemix (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/alchemix\">ALCX)</a>, Enzyme (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/enzyme-finance\">MLN</a>), and Rari (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/rari-governance-token\">RGT</a>) detracted from performance. The Web3 sector was propelled by Aragon (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/aragon-network\">ANT</a>) which ended the week with a 134% return. However, the sector’s returns were offset by the negative performance of the remaining assets in the sector.\n\nDecentralized Exchanges and Smart Contract Platforms were the lagging sectors of the week. The DEX sector was primarily hurt by the weekly performance of SushiSwap (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/sushiswap\">SUSHI</a>), Balancer (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/balancer\">BAL</a>), and Curve (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/curve\">CRV</a>). Similarly, the Smart Contract Platform sector was dragged down by the performance of Kusama (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/kusama\">KSM</a>), Internet Computer (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/internet-computer\">ICP</a>), and Celo (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/celo\">CELO</a>).\n\nSector Portfolio Methodology\n\nFollowing the same approach as previous weeks, this week’s report focuses on comparing the performance, risk, and correlation structure between different sectors. To achieve this, we constructed market-weighted “sector portfolios” by selecting the top assets (ranked by market capitalization) from each sector covered in this report. The sector portfolio allocations are the following using market capitalization data as of June 17th.\n\nSector Drill Down\n\nPerformance during the week ending on June 17th was a bit chaotic. All sector portfolios started the week with disappointing performance with some reaching lows of -15% to -20% in the first few days of the week. However, performance across the board improved starting on June 14th gaining back some of the weekend’s losses. In the latter part of the week, asset prices tumbled once again sending three out of the five sector portfolios to negative territory.\n\nThe Currency sector portfolio was the clear winner of the week finishing up with a 3.1% weekly return. The performance was mainly driven by Bitcoin’s weekly performance which accounts for roughly 60% of the Currency portfolio. The runner-up was the Top Assets portfolio which also benefited from Bitcoin’s performance but was ultimately dragged down by Dogecoin (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/dogecoin\">DOGE</a>) and Uniswap (UNI) which ended the week with -8% and -10% respectively.\n\nThe DEX and DeFi portfolio suffered the most losses ending the week with a -9% return. In both cases, Uniswap was the main driver of performance given its relatively high allocation in the portfolios.\n\nVolatility, defined as the rolling standard deviation of daily log returns, remains elevated across all sector portfolios relative to levels before the market crash in mid-May. However, given the market has been moving sideways without a clear direction since the crash, volatility has stabilized.\n\nThe DEX and DeFi portfolios are currently the ones with the highest risk both running 30-day rolling volatility of 13%. The volatility of the Top Asset and Currency portfolios has been moving in the 6-8% range due to their higher allocation to Bitcoin which has been one of the least volatile assets relative to the rest of the tokens in this report.\n\nAll asset correlations continue to trend higher. The animation below highlights this trend over the past four weeks. As seen below, all correlations between sector portfolios are greater than 85% with certain pairs reaching levels as high as 95%.\n\nInterestingly, the correlation between sector portfolios and Bitcoin is steadily decreasing. Aside from the portfolios that are heavily allocated to Bitcoin (Top Assets and Currency portfolios), all other sector portfolios have experienced some decline since reaching an all-time high last week.\n\nOn the contrary, the correlation with Ethereum is at an all-time high across the board. Aside from the Currency portfolio, all sector portfolios have a correlation with Ethereum higher than 95%.\n\nNormally both statistics move in the same direction; however, this is the first time this kind of dislocation takes place. The reason is that most assets have recently underperformed Bitcoin as investors move down the risk curve to lower volatility assets. As a result, Bitcoin’s market-cap dominance is on the rise increasing roughly 6% over the past 10 days.\n\n",

Following Messari’s sector convention, all five sectors covered in this report ended the week with positive weekly returns. The smart contract platform sector led the way posting a 7-day return of 3.11% propelled by the performance of assets such as Kusama (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/kusama\">KSM</a>), Nervos Network (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/nervos-network\">CKB</a>), Polkadot (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/polkadot\">DOT</a>), Solana (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/solana\">SOL</a>), and Cosmos (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/cosmos\">ATOM</a>). The DeFi and DEX sectors followed closely, ending the week with a 2.7% return. Web3 finished with a 0.12% return making it the worst-performing sector of the group.\n\nSector Portfolio Methodology\n\nSimilar to last week, this week’s report focuses on comparing the performance, risk, and correlation structure between different sectors. To achieve this, we constructed market-weighted “sector portfolios” by selecting the top assets (ranked by market capitalization) from each sector covered in this report. The sector portfolio allocations are the following using market capitalization data as of June 3rd.\n\nSector Drill Down\n\nPerformance during the week ending on June 3rd was a bit bumpy. All sector portfolios had a small rally starting on May 27th which quickly reverted as the week continued. Asset prices across the board tumbled by mid-week resulting in losses of 10-25%. Starting on May 30th, portfolio returns found some footing as prices bounced back regaining some of the performance from earlier in the week.\n\nSector portfolios moved in tandem over the past 7-days following a nicely laid out V-shaped pattern. Although sector performance was relatively tight across all portfolios during most of the week, by the end of the week, the Web3 and DeFi portfolio began to lag the rest finishing the week with losses of -5.5% and -3.7% respectively. The losses of the Web3 portfolio were driven mostly by its relatively high allocation to Chainlink (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/chainlink\">LINK</a>) which ended the week with a -6% return. Uniswap (UNI) and Aave (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/aave\">AAVE</a>), which posted negative returns of -3.6% and -4.7%, drove most of the performance of the DeFi portfolio.\n\nVolatility, defined as the standard deviation of daily returns, remains elevated across all sector portfolios following the spike that was triggered by the market crash in mid-May. Before the crash, volatility across sectors was roughly the same, ranging from 3-6%. After the crash, sector volatility has become widely dispersed.\n\nThe DEX and DeFi portfolios are currently the ones with the highest risk both running 30-day rolling volatility of 13%, a 2x increase compared to levels before the mid-May market crash. In contrast, the Top Asset and Currency portfolios have experienced the least increase in volatility moving roughly 3-4% higher compared to previous levels due to their higher allocation to Bitcoin.\n\nFollowing the market crash, all asset correlations continue to move higher. The animation below highlights this trend over the past four weeks. The correlation matrices shown below are computed on a weekly basis using a 30-day lookback to capture the evolution of the correlation structure between sectors.\n\nAs seen below, correlations between sectors are well above 85% with certain pairs reaching levels as high as 95%. In markets like this where all assets move in unison, investors can get direct directional exposure by simply owning any crypto asset, the only difference is the amount of risk they are willing to take on.\n\nThe correlation between the sector portfolios and Bitcoin continues to steadily increase. The upward trend started in the beginning of May as the markets entered turbulent waters. As of June 3rd, all sector portfolios have a correlation to Bitcoin higher than 80%.\n\nThe increase is most noticeable for the DeFi and DEX portfolios which saw a jump of more than 45% in the past 30 days. The Web3 and Smart Contract Platforms portfolios followed a similar pattern increasing roughly 20% over the same period.\n\nThe correlation between Ethereum and all sector portfolios is now equal to or above 90%. Aside from the portfolios that have a hefty allocation to Ethereum (Smart Contract Platforms and Top Assets), the DeFi and DEX portfolios are the ones with the highest correlation coefficients standing at 94% and 93% respectively.\n\n",

While most assets remain well below their ATH, the market found some footing on Monday 24th possibly marking the end of the market decline. Following Messari’s sector convention, three out of the five sectors covered in this report had negative 7-day returns but nothing as extreme compared to last week’s performance. On the positive side, Web3 and DEXs were the two sectors with positive performance for the week. On the contrary, Currencies and DeFi were the underperforming sectors of the week with a negative return of -3.5% and -3.9%.\n\nSector Portfolio Methodology\n\nThis week’s report revolves around comparing the performance, risk, and correlation structure between different sectors. In order to achieve this, we selected the top assets (ranked by market capitalization) from each of the sectors covered in this report and constructed a market-weighted portfolio that acts as a proxy for the overall sector. The sector portfolio allocations are the following using market capitalization data as of May 27th.\n\nThe following analytics are derived using this set of portfolios in order to get an estimated comparison of their relative performance with each other.\n\nSector Portfolio Deep Dive\n\nPerformance across the market continued to deteriorate well into the March 20th to March 27th week. Starting March 20th, all sectors rebounded experiencing a sudden bounce in prices with some reaching a 15-25% performance in one single day. However, the pump was short-lived across all sectors as the market continued to decline in the coming days. Starting on Monday 24th, the market found some relief as asset prices began to turn around signaling the potential end to the sudden market crashed triggered last week.\n\nSector portfolios moved in tandem over the past 7-days following a nicely laid out V-shaped pattern. Cumulative performance starting on May 20th across sectors sunk as much as 30% by mid-week but quickly bounced back capturing back some of the early gains of the week. Although sector performance was relatively tight across all portfolios during most of the week, by the end of the week Web3 and DEXs began to outpace the rest of the groups. Both portfolios finished the week with a 28% return followed by the smart contract platform portfolio which ended the week with a 23% return. The currencies portfolio underperforming the rest posting a weekly return of 8%.\n\nFrom a volatility perspective, defined as the standard deviation of daily returns, all sector portfolios saw a similar spike starting in mid-May as the market began its drastic decline. Before the crash, volatility across sectors ranged from 3-6%. After the crash, sector volatility is ranging from a low of 6% to a high of 12%. The DEX portfolio, composed primarily of Uniswap, PancakeSwap, and THORChain, experience the highest increase in volatility moving from 6% to an all-time high of 12.5% over the past two weeks. The top asset and currency portfolios are the least volatile primarily due to their higher allocation to Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nAs of consequence of the market crash, all asset correlations reached new all-time highs. The animation below highlights this tendency towards higher correlation over the past four weeks. The correlation matrices shown below are computed on a weekly basis using a 30-day lookback to accurately depict the evolution of the correlation structure between the sector portfolios. As seen below, correlations between sectors are well above 80% with certain pairs reaching levels as high as 95%. One caveat worth highlight is that some sector portfolios share the same underlying assets which directly results in higher correlation coefficients between some pairs.\n\nThe correlation between the sector portfolios and Bitcoin has been increasing since the beginning of May. The trend accelerated in mid-May as the market went belly up. The acceleration is most noticeable in the DeFi and DEX portfolios which saw a jump of roughly 20% in the past two weeks and approximately 40% since the beginning of the month. The Web3 and smart contract platform portfolio have seen a more gradual increase in their correlation coefficients going from 70% at the beginning of May to 85-87% by the end of the month. Unsurprisingly, the top assets and currency portfolios have a correlation greater than 95% as a result of Bitcoin’s dominance in the portfolios. As of May 27th, the correlation coefficient across all sector portfolios is greater than 80%.\n\nThe correlation between Ethereum and all sector portfolios is also well above 80%. Aside from the portfolios that have a hefty allocation to Ethreuem (smart contract platforms and top assets), the DeFi and DEX portfolios are the ones with the highest correlation coefficients standing at 91% and 89% as of yesterday. This is roughly 10% higher when compared to the correlation of both portfolios with Bitcoin potentially signaling that DeFi assets are beginning to decouple from Bitcoin. As of yesterday, the correlation coefficient of all sector portfolios is greater than 85%.\n\n",

      "content": "Week In Review\n\nNotable Messari Enterprise Updates\n\nZilliqa team <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/48de0869-31a3-48d5-98aa-953fae015e69\">released</a> v8.0.3 of its mainnet client.\nVoting on a proposal to <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/d4f0b82b-0bd8-49e2-bc91-43846c06239d\">add</a> Kyber DMM to KyberDAO\nCGP-28 <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/de804a63-1da6-42a9-abc4-7c55e5fb8546\">passed</a> its referendum period which ended on May 13, 2021, and its proposed code changes were executed on May 18, 2021.\nSushiswap team <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/b2f2fadc-22cc-4839-8ca5-a04bd3ae3330\">announced</a> that the native token launchpad, called MISO (Minimal Initial SushiSwap Offering) will be launched on May 20, 2021.\n\nSector Performance Overview\n\nThe week ending May 20th saw one of the biggest drawdowns in recent months. The market as a whole tumbled more than 40% from its peak with riskier tokens suffering even higher losses. Volatility reared its ugly head reminding everyone that crypto markets are not for the faint of heart. As performance during the week deteriorated, market volatility increased across the board. Additionally, asset correlations saw a massive spike across all sectors covered in this report driven by the market correction.\n\nOver the week the currency sector suffered the least compared to other sectors. The sector – composed of Bitcoin, Doge, etc – ended the week with a -16% loss closely followed by DeFi which posted a negative return of -19%. Decentralized exchanges and Web3 suffered most severely with total weekly losses of -22% and -26% respectively.\n\nThere was no single catalyst that can explain the past week’s movements. The selldown began on the back of Elon’s tweets that Tesla was no longer accepting Bitcoin as a form of payment due to environmental concerns. Macroeconomic concerns also contributed, mainly from the higher than expected inflation print of 4.2% year-on-year sparking fears of tapering. Early in the week, newsflow of Binance facing regulatory scrutiny and reiterations from 2017 that China doesn’t accept crypto as a form of payment also exacerbated the issue.\n\nThe main culprit has been increased leverage. Binance, the world’s largest exchange, has seen positive funding rates for the past months:\n\n<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/ethereum\">ETH</a> investors also saw climbing open interest, indicating that demand was not based on spot buying in recent weeks.\n\nTowards the end of the week, funding rates were erratic, with some exchanges printing positive rates and others printing negative rates (see chart below). This showed that markets were still disorderly. Predicted funding rates also kept spiking at each dip, as long traders bought the dip. However, as prices moved down, traders increasingly bought until they triggered the next liquidation cascade, causing prices to dive further. An example is FTX (where there is more intra-day granular data) -- rates were still climbing on the week until it capitulated on May 20.\n\nThe activity was exacerbated on Wednesday as many centralized exchanges were congested, delaying clients from trading. The Ethereum network also saw heavy use, anecdotally printing $1,600 in gas fees for transactions, even to avoid liquidation. As a result of the trading friction, prices were slow to find footing.\n\nSector Drill Down - Risk and Performance Review\n\nTop Assets\n\nIn the early days of the week, performance in the top ten assets (by market cap) fluctuated around zero with some assets performing well while others lagged. By mid-week, performance took a nasty turn, shifting a positive week into a bloodbath. By the end of the week, all top assets finished the session with double-digit losses. Cardano (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/cardano\">ADA</a>) and Dogecoin (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/dogecoin\">DOGE</a>) were the least affected in the group ending the week with returns of -13% and -26%. Ethereum (ETH), Chainlink (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/chainlink\">LINK</a>), Uniswap (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/uniswap\">UNI</a>), Litecoin (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/litecoin\">LTC</a>), and Binance coin (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/binance-coin\">BNB</a>) suffered the most, losing over 40% over the week.\n\nUnsurprisingly, volatility across the top ten experienced a sudden spike. On a 30-day rolling basis, volatility increased roughly 5% for most assets over the week. In previous weeks, volatility ranged between 5% and 9% however, volatility across the group is now above 10%. Bitcoin is the only exception with rolling volatility of 6%.\n\nAs the market came crashing down, correlations in the group went through the roof. As of yesterday, 30-day correlations among top assets are well above 50%.\n\nCorrelation with Bitcoin also increased dramatically over the week. Dogecoin’s (DOGE) correlation increased over 60% during the week while Uniswap (UNI) saw a jump of roughly 30%. All assets now have a correlation greater than 60% with some reaching highs of 80%.\n\nDeFi\n\nFollowing the same pace as the rest of the market, DeFi assets dumped heavily during the week. For the majority of the week, assets moved sideways without tilting towards any specific direction. On Tuesday, SushiSwap (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/sushiswap\">SUSHI</a>), Synthetic (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/synthetix\">SNX</a>), and Aave (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/aave\">AAVE</a>) had a nice rally which turned out to be short-lived. Similar to the top ten, DeFi assets ended the week with two-digit losses ranging from -23% to -51%. Uniswap (UNI) and PancakeSwap (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/pancakeswap\">CAKE</a>) experienced the largest losses ending the week with negative returns of -45% and -52%. Arguably, they were also most held tokens as leaders in the decentralized exchange (DEX) segment.\n\nNotably, total value locked (TVL) in the Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Ethereum ecosystems were impacted. From the peak, BSC and ETH lost -62% and -27% of TVL in USD terms. This indicates that tokens in Ethereum DeFi largely were not withdrawn from protocols. BSC saw an exploit on BUNNY, perhaps worsening the performance of their overall TVL.\n\nVolatility within DeFi increased past its 3-month high reaching levels above 10% across all assets. Notably, ThorChain’s (<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/thorchain\">RUNE</a>) Rune’s volatility doubled going from 7% to 14% in the span of three days. Within the group, SushiSwap (SUSHI) is the riskiest asset with rolling volatility of 16%.
