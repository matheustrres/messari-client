The ‘Network’, ‘Financial’, and ‘Staking and Decentralization’ overviews are explored in the <a href=\"https://messari.io/article/state-of-cardano-q2-2023?utmmedium=referral&utmsource=ecosystem&utmcampaign=stateofcardanoq22023\">State of Cardano Q2 2023</a> report. In addition, Cardano uses a variant of the unspent transaction output (UTXO) accounting model, like Bitcoin. Activity metrics such as those involving address and transfers are fundamentally different from those on networks with account-based accounting models (e.g., Ethereum, Solana).  \n\nEcosystem Performance Analysis\n\nAverage daily dapp transactions increased for the third consecutive quarter. Dapp activity accelerated to a 49.0% QoQ increase in Q2, averaging 57,900 daily transactions.\n\nMinswap, an automated market maker (AMM), was the most popular Cardano dapp by transactions in Q2, clearing 1 million monthly transactions in May and June. Increasing 167.5% QoQ, Minswap surpassed the leading NFT marketplace jpg.store in dapp transactions. This aligned with an overall sectoral shift, as DeFi activity rose and NFT activity declined.  \n\nTVL (USD) also increased in Q2, up 9.7% QoQ to $151.7 million. This TVL increase is impressive in light of ADA’s 26.9% price decline in Q2. Cardano’s 198.6% YTD increase in TVL (USD) boosted its TVL ranking among all networks from 34th to 21st in 2023.\n\nStablecoins, arguably the most important piece of infrastructure behind this TVL run, also grew in both absolute and relative terms. The total stablecoin market cap grew 34.9% QoQ from $10.0 million to $13.5 million. Relative to other networks, Cardano’s stablecoin market cap moved up from 54th to 37th in 2023. Stable assets are ideal for pairing in liquidity pools, borrowing and lending, creating leverage, and quickly escaping volatility, which is quite common in the crypto market.\n\nDeFi\n\nMinswap remains the liquidity king of Cardano DeFi, ending Q2 with a TVL of $48.8 million and 32.2% dominance. AGIX/ADA was the most popular LP on Minswap, accounting for 37% of TVL as of the beginning of Q2, according to Minswap DAO (AGIX is a token for SingularityNet). Synthetic asset issuer Indigo Protocol, which was open-sourced in April, ended Q2 with a TVL of $31.5 million, increasing its dominance from 17.4% to 20.8%. Via Indigo’s Proposal #18 for an ADA/INDY incentivized liquidity pool was launched on Minswap.\n\nThe ADA deposited into Minswap’s liquidity pools (LPs) was previously all delegated to one stake pool. With the increase in TVL, that stake pool has become oversaturated. In June, a working group was recently formed to decide how to delegate additional LP ADA.\n\nNewer protocols grew in absolute terms as well as relative terms, i.e., TVL dominance. Notable protocols launched in 2023 include:\n\nVyFinance, a multi-headed platform with a DEX, redistributive mechanism (BAR), vaults, and more.\nLiqwid Finance, a borrowing and lending protocol.\nDjed, a stablecoin issuer.\nOptim Finance, a yield aggregator.\n\nStablecoins\n\nIndigo and Djed are the two main stablecoin issuers on Cardano. They issue the overcollateralized tokens iUSD and DJED, respectively. Indigo and Djed offer other tokens as well, such as Indigo’s synthetic asset iETH and Djed’s reserve token SHEN, which also contribute to TVL. Between the overcollateralization of the stablecoins themselves and the other assets created, protocol TVL is several times higher than the stablecoin market cap in the case of both issuers.\n\nUsers lock up ADA on Indigo as collateral in order to generate iUSD or other synthetic assets, known as a collateralized debt position (CDP). Liquidations occur in CDPs when the value of the locked-up collateral falls below a predefined threshold, triggering a margin call. If the CDP holder fails to address the margin call, the platform initiates a liquidation process, where a portion of the collateral is auctioned off to repay the borrowed stablecoins and fees. Liquidations help maintain the stability and solvency of the lending platform, ensuring that undercollateralized positions are resolved and reducing the platform's exposure to risk.\n\nFollowing the <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/79ad00d4-9b49-40b0-b3e2-6173bd08863d\">SEC-induced</a> ADA flash crash on June 6, hundreds of users were liquidated on Indigo Protocol, the largest stablecoin and synthetic asset issuer. Indigo performed well during its first true test of volatility. The protocol avoided any significant depegging when it liquidated millions of dollars worth of iUSD, iETH, and iBTC, even if the liquidations were slow.  \n\nIn Q2, Indigo saw a total liquidation volume of $3.6 million from 870 liquidations. The June 10 spike included two of the top three liquidations by volume: one iETH liquidation worth $354,000 and one iBTC liquidation worth $262,000. These greatly exceeded the average volume of $39,000.\n\nMELD, a borrowing and lending protocol, had concerns over the liquidation process with Cardano’s architecture in April that prevented them from launching. The absence of a fee market on Cardano makes the liquidation process different from that of established lending protocols and stablecoin issuers on other chains, such as Ethereum’s MakerDAO. IOG is working with the MELD team to address this risk of bad debt.\n\nDuring the ADA flash crash, Indigo’s liquidation queue extended to nearly two hours for ~200 liquidations. This long queue was primarily a result of having a single liquidation bot processing liquidations serially. Other contributing factors were throughput limitations and concurrency limitations typical of DeFi architectures on Cardano. Given that batching transactions does not alleviate all concurrency limitations, Indigo chooses not to operate its own batchers over centralization concerns. The long queue gave more time for users to deposit more collateral to avoid being frozen/liquidated. It also left more time for collateral value to dip below the loan value, potentially creating bad debt, which was part of MELD’s concern. Indigo’s stability pool successfully worked as a preventative measure against bad debt, preventing any from occurring in Q2.\n\nIndigo has witnessed 21 governance polls since December 2022, and its development roadmap items include:\n\nTransaction chaining for the liquidation bot to further address queue times. This will increase throughput to process liquidations faster.\nUpdating the liquidation bot to process liquidations in parallel.\nOracle integrations, which will enable for support of new assets such as iEUR.\nAutomating rewards in collaboration with the Sundae Labs team.\n\nDJED has its own hurdles to overcome, mainly with liquidity, as the token spent much of June priced around the $1.05 range. DJED requires a minimum reserve ratio of 400% with its reserve token SHEN. When the reserve ratio falls below that threshold, additional DJED cannot be minted, which can cause the existing DJED to trade at a premium. While it can depeg upwards (  $1.00), its redemption mechanism prevents a prolonged downward depeg ($1.00). When DJED depegs upwards, which it did in Q2, it disincentivizes the burning of the stablecoin, as users would have to pay $1.00 to redeem for $1.00. As a result, an upwards depeg can further delay repegging.\n\nNFTs\n\nNFT metrics were down QoQ nearly across the board. Average daily NFT transactions were down 35.7% QoQ to 2,900, and total quarterly trading volume fell 41.9% QoQ to $46.2 million. This is in line with the broader market, as even blue-chip collection floor prices have been dropping in 2023.  \n\nOverall, NFT activity is still driven by unique buyers rather than unique sellers, i.e., a relatively small number of sellers continues to sell to a larger number of buyers. NFT sales volume is largely concentrated in jpg.store with its 98% dominance. The next largest marketplace is the collection-specific market for SpaceBudz.\n\nOut of over 8,900 total verified NFT projects:\n\n13 projects have crossed 10 million ADA in trading volume.\n131 projects have crossed 1 million ADA.\n501 projects have crossed 100,000 ADA.\n\nMany developments in the NFT sector are not related to traditional PFP projects, but rather, they are related to real-world use cases and gaming. Notable NFT initiatives in Q2 include:\n\nThe UN Refugee Agency uses proceeds from NFT projects to assist refugees and fund their WRFGS stake pool to support long-term charity initiatives.\nEmpowa, a grant recipient from Fund 5 of Project Catalyst, used NFTs to fund a housing project pilot. The program aims to provide affordable, environmentally responsible housing as well as accessible housing loans.\nPaima’s Stateful NFTs carry dynamic data such as game stats and achievements.\n\nMilkomeda C1\n\nMilkomeda C1 launched in early 2022 as Cardano’s first sidechain. It brought EVM compatibility to Cardano. While Milkomeda C1 does use a different virtual machine from Cardano, it still uses wrapped ADA as the base asset for fees and gas. Milkomeda C1 is primarily maintained by dcSpark.\n\nThe more promising metrics that represent new developments on Milkomeda are daily unique contract callers and daily total contract calls, which surged 279.9% and 273.2% QoQ, respectively. These increases can be attributed to the gaming sector. The Paima Engine is a framework for rollups focused on creating on-chain games and autonomous worlds. Paima-built r",

Through 2023, Cardano moved up from 34th to 21st in TVL ranking across all chains.\nHydra Head development continued with proposed topologies, interest from ecosystem teams, and a demo shared.\nMilkomeda C1, Midnight, Wanchain, and IOG’s sidechains team continue to build towards increased interoperability and new use cases in the greater Cardano ecosystem.\n\nPrimer on Cardano\n\n<a href=\"https://messari.io/report/cardano-slow-and-steady\">Cardano</a> is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Layer-1 smart contract network launched in 2017. Cardano’s PoS mechanism allows for delegation of stake. Cardano aims to provide security, scalability, and sustainability to decentralized applications and systems building on top of the blockchain. In addition to the community of developers, node operators, and projects, Cardano is supported by multiple entities: Input Output Global (IOG), dcSpark, The Cardano Foundation, EMURGO, and more. They work together to support the network’s development, adoption, and finances while Cardano moves toward the age of Voltaire.\n\nCardano has taken a unique approach to development when compared to other smart contract networks, based on a phased roadmap:  \n\nCardano’s development is methodical and deliberate — prioritizing sustainability and stability over speed. For example, smart contracts were not enabled until the Alonzo hard fork in 2021, over four years after the network launched.\nThe extended unspent transaction output (eUTXO) accounting model enables native token transfers, scalability, and decentralization.\nCardano has offered liquid staking and economic models to incentivize decentralization on its <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/cardano-slow-and-steady#Technology\">Ouroboros</a> PoS consensus model since inception.\n\nWith a dedicated community of users and developers, Cardano has demonstrated staying power. Post-Alonzo, Cardano began to compete in more traditional crypto markets, such as DeFi and NFTs, while remaining focused on its core goals.\n\nKey Metrics\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nNote that Cardano uses a variant of the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) accounting model, like Bitcoin. Activity metrics such as those involving addresses and transfers are fundamentally different from those on networks with account-based accounting models (e.g., Ethereum, Solana).\n\nNetwork Overview\n\nThe average transaction fee increased 8.5% QoQ from $0.117 to $0.126. Despite the increase in back-to-back quarters, the average transaction fee (USD) is still down 50.8% YoY, because of lower YoY ADA prices. Each transaction on the network is accompanied by a fee for processing actions and storage costs. Fees are calculated by a minimum payable fee in addition to transaction size.\n\nVarious growing niches on Cardano, such as DeFi, have not been enough to increase overall activity metrics. Daily active addresses declined again in Q2, down 4.0% QoQ from 60,200 to 57,800. This marks the fourth QoQ decrease in address activity in the past five quarters.\n\nTransaction activity, on the other hand, did increase in Q2. Average daily transactions were up 1.9% QoQ from 67,500 to 68,800. This is important to note as movement in transactions and active addresses are typically correlated, but have deviated slightly in recent quarters. The ratio of transactions to active addresses has been growing steadily over the past five quarters, suggesting that the average user is more active now than they previously were. In Q2, the Transaction / Active Address ratio of 1.19 was up 6.1% QoQ and 13.2% YoY.\n\nCardano’s average blockchain load increased from just under 40% in Q1 to over 50% in Q2. Average daily load in Q2 peaked at 81.2% in May, a level not seen since early 2022. A 100% load would mean that all blocks are full (currently 90 kb per block), and 0% load would mean that all blocks are empty. Smaller transactions, created by more efficient coin selection algorithms, would help increase Cardano’s TPS and bandwidth in the event of a 100% blockchain load.\n\nCoin selection algorithms affect block load, fees, and general network metrics. Development team dcSpark recently launched a UTXO Selection Benchmarking tool to help wallet developers create more efficient coin selection algorithms. Different algorithms have varying processes to select UTXOs to build transactions and directly affect how ‘change’ (change refers to the leftover funds from a transaction that are sent back to the original sender's address) is distributed. There are various heuristics used by data infrastructure providers that account for nuances in the UTXO system, but not all 'change' is caught by these heuristics; change can look very different depending on the wallet building the transaction and which UTXOs are available in the user's wallet in the first place.\n\nFinancial Overview\n\nADA’s price and market cap pulled back after a 53.5% increase in Q1. Despite the 26.9% QoQ decline, ADA is still up 12.0% YTD. ADA’s Q2 pullback made it lag behind the overall crypto market, which was up 0.1% QoQ. ADA is the native asset of Cardano and has three primary use cases: (1) settling network fees, (2) being used to register a stake pool to participate in network consensus as a pool operator, and (3) staking as a pool operator or delegator to help secure the network and earn token rewards.\n\nAdditionally, ADA is being used to reward voters and fund projects in Project Catalyst, Cardano’s decentralized innovation engine that uses a novel governance process to fund ecosystem projects via the Cardano Treasury. Project Catalyst is explored in depth in the Qualitative Analysis of this report. Cardano’s Treasury balance grew 8.5% to 1.30 billion ADA during Q2. The 100 million ADA increase is generally in line with growth from previous quarters. Due to ADA price depreciation, the treasury’s value in USD terms decreased 20.7% QoQ from $452 million to $358 million.\n\nThe nominal staking yield on Cardano is generally 3.3% for ADA delegators, although it can vary by stake pool. Real yield is calculated as nominal yield minus inflation to account for any value dilution due to inflation and was 3.28% in Q2. Any reference to inflation refers to ADA’s circulating supply rather than total supply since ADA’s supply is capped at 45 billion. Each epoch, 0.3% of ADA reserves (i.e., the ADA not in circulation) is used for SPO rewards.\n\nThe SEC separately charged both <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/e1fbfd61-f6af-412d-a1c4-9deea7a883bd\">Binance US</a> and <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/79ad00d4-9b49-40b0-b3e2-6173bd08863d\">Coinbase</a> in early June and, in the process, alleged various crypto assets to be securities. One of the alleged assets was ADA. While there was no court ruling or clarification on ADA, some <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/weekly-recap-ripple-coinbase-wallet-and-more\">insight</a> may be gained from the SEC’s case regarding <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-xrp-ledger-q2-2023\">XRP</a>. A judge ruled that XRP, the token itself, is not an investment contract and thus not in and of itself a security.\n\nADA’s price dropped 22.4% (from $0.352 to $0.273) in one week from June 6 to June 11. On June 9, ADA dipped 25.2% in 24 hours (from $0.318 to $0.238), which caused a series of liquidations on DeFi borrowing protocols.\n\nEcosystem Overview\n\nAverage daily dapp transactions have increased for the third consecutive quarter. Dapp activity accelerated to a 49.0% QoQ increase in Q2, averaging 57,900 daily transactions.  \n\nMinswap, an automated market maker (AMM), was the most popular Cardano dapp by transactions in Q2, clearing 1 million monthly transactions in May and June. Increasing 167.5% QoQ, Minswap surpassed leading NFT marketplace jpg.store for most dapp transactions. This aligned with an overall sectoral shift, as DeFi activity rose and NFT activity declined. Minswap remains the liquidity king of Cardano DeFi, ending Q2 with a TVL of $48.8 million and 32.2% dominance.\n\nTVL (USD) also increased in Q2, up 9.7% QoQ to $151.7 million. This TVL increase is impressive in the face of ADA’s price decline. Cardano’s 198.6% YTD increase in TVL (USD) has boosted its TVL ranking among all networks from 34th to 21st in 2023.\n\nStablecoins, arguably the most important piece of infrastructure that is fueling this TVL run, also grew in both absolute and relative terms. The total stablecoin market cap grew 34.9% QoQ from $10.0 million to $13.5 million. Relative to other networks, Cardano’s stablecoin market cap moved up from 54th to 37th in 2023. Stable assets are ideal for pairing in liquidity pools, borrowing and lending, creating leverage, and quick escapes from volatility - which is quite common in the crypto market.\n\nStaking and Decentralization Overview\n\nThe number of stake pools and delegators did not change significantly in Q2. Stake pools are run by various entities, such as individuals (public or anonymous) or organizations (crypto-native or other). Regardless of the entity in charge, many stake pool operators (SPOs) operate several pools, due to the current incentives limiting the maximum size of a pool. Accounting for multi-pools, there were 1,921 unique SPOs in Q2. Not all SPOs identify their pools in ways that can be linked, so the real number may be slightly lower.\n\nStake and delegator distribution were largely unbalanced across total pools in Q1.  \n\nOf the 22.7 billion total stake, the top 188 pools (6.5% of pools) accounted for over 50%.\nOf the 1.29 million total delegators, the top 47 pools (1.6% of pools) accounted for over 50%.  \n\nOf the total 2,912 stake pools, 1,108 (38.0%) created one or more blocks during the final epoch of Q2. The most productive stake pools produced 70+ blocks during the epoch, which lasted five days.\n\nActive stake decreased 7.7% QoQ to 22.7 bi",

      "content": "Key Insights\n\nActivity on Pocket Network increased over the past four quarters, as relays serviced grew 2% QoQ and 41% YoY.\nWith a 38% QoQ fall in POKT-USD price and a 15% QoQ decline in the POKT inflation (3% more POKT was still minted), total revenue decreased 45% QoQ in USD terms.\nThe total revenue drop was driven by a 47% QoQ decrease in the USD value of supply-side revenue (minting), accounting for 97% of total revenue. Simultaneously, protocol revenue (POKT burns) accounted for 3% of total revenue.\nWhile staking participation remained constant at about 62% of the current 1.6 billion total supply, Q2’23 saw over 1 billion of total POKT staked for the first time.\nIn Q2’23, Pocket Network completed voting on five governance proposals, out of which four were approved and required a total commitment of $175,000.\nPocket Network’s V1 upgrade scheduled for early 2024 aims to improve utility, introduce a new consensus, and improve peer-to-peer communication and the data persistence module.\n\nPrimer on Pocket Network\n\nPocket Network is a Web3 node infrastructure protocol that creates a two-sided marketplace for RPC node providers to offer developers access to blockchain data.\n\nA remote procedure call (RPC) is an application programming interface (API) interaction that allows apps to communicate with servers on a shared network like Ethereum. RPC nodes enable users (applications/developers) to communicate with blockchains. Relays (calls) to RPC nodes are usually required by apps, exchanges, wallets, and analytical tools for a range of tasks including, but not limited to, retrieving wallet balances and smart contract event logs, or interacting with DeFi liquidity pools.\n\nPocket Network’s protocol runs atop its Proof-of-Stake blockchain, which uses a <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/how-are-web3-infrastructure-protocols-trying-to-capture-value\">Stake-for-Access</a> (SFA) model, also known as a work token model. In other words, Pocket requires its node providers to stake the native token (POKT) to provide services on the network. Simultaneously, end users are required to stake POKT to access the network’s services. Previously, the protocol would mint new POKT for each relay, directly paying nodes through minting rather than paying for each RPC relay. Inflation is no longer tied to relays and is, instead, determined through Pocket DAO governance. Most recently, Parameter Update Proposal-32 (PUP-32) set the minting to roughly 220,000 POKT per day (~4.9% inflation). Currently, service nodes earn POKT in proportion to their stake-weight (and rewards multipliers).\n\nAdditionally, since the implementation of Pocket Improvement Proposal-29 (PIP-29) in May 2023, Pocket gateways (access portals) must pay a $0.00000085 fee per relay to the Pocket DAO, which is then burned. This fee is called the GatewayFeePerRelay parameter, which specifies how much USD-equivalent POKT the gateway operators owe for every relay they send through the network. Of note, paying Pocket users spend an average of $0.000004 per relay, which shows that gateways (currently only the Pocket Portal) are still net positive in fees earned after paying the gateway fee per relay to the DAO.\n\nThe key participants in Pocket Network are described below.\n\nService Nodes: These nodes stake POKT to provide servicing relays to users (applications/developers); get compensated in POKT per relay fulfilled and proved; retain 85% of total POKT rewarded for relays.\nValidator Nodes: These nodes stake POKT to validate the PoS blockchain; confirm blocks that contain proofs of the relays serviced; retain 5% of total POKT rewarded for relays and 1% of POKT paid for transaction fees (the other 99% is sent to the Pocket DAO).\nUsers: Often applications or developers that stake POKT to request RPC relays to various blockchains. Currently, staking is conducted through the Pocket Portal. The Pocket V1 upgrade will change this dynamic by enabling decentralized demand-side access points for gateways and users.\nPocket DAO: A whitelisted group of holders of the POKTDAO token (on Gnosis Chain), which is strictly used for governance on Snapshot and currently has a supply of 61 POKTDAO. Members must go through a <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/governor-note-proof-of-participation-governance\">proof-of-participation onboarding process</a> before admission to the DAO. The DAO votes on Pocket’s monetary policy, validator requirements, and other protocol updates while retaining 10% of total POKT rewarded for relays and 99% of transaction fees.\nGateways: Access points for developers to use the Pocket Network. Gateways must pay the Pocket DAO a $0.00000085 fee per relay serviced that is then burned by the DAO on a weekly basis. Currently, the Pocket Portal is the only gateway available and is operated by Pocket Network Inc. Pocket plans to launch its first community-run gateway by Q4’23.\n\nWebsite / Twitter / Discord\n\nKey Metrics\n\nActivity on Pocket Network increased over the past four quarters, as relays serviced grew 2% QoQ and 41% YoY. The amount of POKT staked grew steadily over the past year, with Q2’23 seeing over 1 billion of total POKT staked for the first time. Regarding financials, the 38% QoQ fall in POKT-USD price and 15% QoQ decline in the POKT inflation in Q2’23 led total revenue to decrease by 45% QoQ in USD terms.\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nRelay Requests\n\nPocket users are usually applications or developers submitting relay requests (API requests) to service nodes. These relay requests are routed to any of the supported relay chains. Service nodes then receive a response from a relay chain and forward it to the requesting application. The interaction between users and service nodes represents the fundamental utility of Pocket Network. Thus, the demand for Pocket Network’s services can be derived by measuring relay requests.\n\nRelays are the most important metric for determining the activity and health of Pocket. Despite falls in Pocket transaction volume, staked nodes, and the price of the POKT token, Pocket Network saw a 2% QoQ growth in relays serviced to 107 billion relays (i.e., almost 1.2 billion relays serviced daily). The movement builds on the overall growth in relays throughout the past year, up 41% YoY.\n\nStaked and Jailed Service Nodes\n\nStaked service nodes route relay requests from users (applications/developers) to relay chains, then forward the responses back to applications. Nodes that unstake POKT are referred to as unstaking nodes and must wait 21 days before their POKT is unstaked. Jailed nodes are staked service nodes that double-sign a block or fail to sign a certain amount of blocks within a set time period.\n\nWhile average staked nodes declined over the past four quarters to nearly 21,000 in Q2’23, the percentage of unstaking nodes versus staked nodes continued its downward trend as well. It fell to 4% in Q2’23, down from almost 6% in Q1’23. Simultaneously, jailed nodes followed a similar downtrend over the past four quarters.\n\nUnique Block Proposers\n\nValidators are service nodes that also propose and validate blocks on the Pocket blockchain. Hence, all validators are service nodes, but not all service nodes are validators. The top 1,000 service nodes for POKT staked can become validators (which keeps validators constant). Validators earn 1% of transaction fees and 5% of POKT inflation when they are a proposer for a given block.\n\nThe number of average daily unique block proposers remained stable at 96 in Q2’23 and has been steadily increasing over the past four quarters. The rise in unique block proposers shows that POKT is becoming more widely distributed among the validator set. Given that block rewards are only sent to the proposers, the mechanism distributing POKT is even further decentralizing the holder base as more unique validators continue to propose new blocks.\n\nPOKT Supply\n\nPocket Network has an inflating total supply of 1.6 billion POKT where newly minted POKT goes to key network participants: 85% to service nodes, 5% to block proposers (validators), and 10% to the Pocket DAO. Because relays are paid through the dilution of POKT (minting to the key participants), measuring the total supply by staked and non-staked POKT shows the percentage of POKT utilized for services on Pocket Network.\n\nPocket uses a <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/how-are-web3-infrastructure-protocols-trying-to-capture-value?referrer=all-research\">Stake-for-Access</a> (SFA) token model to capture value. Hence, observing the total POKT supply through the lens of staked and non-staked POKT reveals what percentage of POKT is being used. An average of over 60% of the POKT supply has been staked over the past four quarters. Despite falls in other metrics such as price and transaction volume, most of the POKT token continues to be utilized throughout the network.\n\nQ2’23 saw over 1 billion of total POKT staked, up 3% QoQ and up 21% YoY. In Q2’23, service nodes accounted for over 90% of the POKT staked, whereas less than 1% were staked by users (via the Pocket Portal). Of note, the Pocket V1 upgrade will enable decentralized demand-side access points for gateways and applications/developers, giving users a more direct way to stake on Pocket.\n\nTotal Revenue\n\nPocket Network’s total revenue is calculated from multiple sources:\n\nSupply-side revenue (minting): This revenue comes from inflation, where 85% is minted directly to service nodes based on the number of relays serviced and 5% is minted to block proposers (validators). What’s not recorded as revenue is the remaining 10% that goes to Pocket DAO.\nTransaction fee revenue: This revenue accounts for the 1% of the transaction fees rewarded to block proposers, while the remaining 99% that goes to Pocket DAO is not considered revenue.\nProtocol revenue (burns): This revenue accounts for gateway fees being burned. That is, after PIP-29, a gateway fee per relay of $0.00000085 was introduced where gateway operators send gateway fees to Pocket DAO to",

      "content": "Key Insights\n\nAt the end of Q2, a vote passed to enact a token-based governance system using off-chain voting platform Snapshot. The system will bring greater utility to the SKL token and increase community ownership of the network.\nSKALE developers announced Levitation Protocol and SKALE G, which will bring zk-rollups to the SKALE network. The protocols are estimated to launch on mainnet in Q4 2023.\nPVP game CryptoBlades accounted for the majority of network usage in Q2. The game had a 67% share and 85% share of total SKALE transactions and daily active addresses, respectively.\nThe Nebula gaming Hub witnessed increased usage driven by the launches of games, most notably Untitled Platformer. The Hub’s average daily transactions and active addresses increased QoQ by 422% and 69%, respectively.\n\nPrimer on SKALE\n\nSKALE is a Layer-1 (L1) sidechain framework with pooled security. A set of Ethereum smart contracts manage several core network functions, including staking, validator orchestration, BLS key generation for each SKALE chain, and more. SKALE supports a network of configurable EVM-compatible, dapp, or general-purpose chains (SKALE chains). Each SKALE chain is secured by a rotating subset of SKALE’s pooled validator set. The SKALE V2 upgrade in Q2’22 brought interoperability between SKALE chains. \n\nSKALE also differentiates itself by offering zero gas fees to end users. To generate fees, the protocol instead collects subscription fees from developers to create a new SKALE chain. SKALE contributors SKALE Labs and the Network of Decentralized Economics (N.O.D.E.) Foundation are specifically targeting gaming and other retail use cases via their development and growth efforts. At the end of Q2’23, SKL tokenholders passed a proposal to initiate token-based governance over protocol parameters using off-chain governance platform Snapshot. For a full primer on SKALE, refer to our Initiation of Coverage <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/skaleing-with-evm-app-chains\">report</a>.\n\nWebsite / Twitter / Discord  \n\nKey Metrics\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nQ2’23 was an up-and-down quarter for the overall crypto market. In the first half of the quarter, a <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/pepe-by-the-numbers?referrer=all-research\">meme coin</a> craze drove up on-chain activity and prices. After a brief period of relative calm, several U.S. regulatory events, including enforcement actions against <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/79ad00d4-9b49-40b0-b3e2-6173bd08863d\">Coinbase</a> and <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/e1fbfd61-f6af-412d-a1c4-9deea7a883bd\">Binance</a>, drove the market down. Among other claims, these enforcement actions alleged that several Layer-1 tokens are securities. BTC and ETH were not part of these allegations; thus, alt-L1 tokens generally experienced more negative price action.\n\nAlthough SKL was not named in any of the claims, it was still affected by the market downturn. Following a 107% QoQ rally in Q1’23, SKL’s market cap decreased 29% QoQ to $118 million. From quarter start to end, SKL’s market cap rank among all cryptocurrencies slightly fell from 168th to 171st.\n\nThe SKL token has three primary use cases: SKALE chain subscription fees, network security (via validator staking), and, starting at the end of Q2’23, governance.\n\nSubscription Fees\n\nSKALE has a unique revenue model because it subsidizes gas costs rather than charging the end user. SKALE still has a gas token (sFUEL) to combat network attacks like DDoS, but it does not have any monetary value and users can receive it from token faucets. To generate fees, the protocol instead charges developers an SKL subscription fee for creating their own SKALE chain. This subscription fee is distributed to validators (and then passed down to delegators). The subscription fee model is expected to evolve in the following three phases, subject to governance:\n\nPhase 1 emphasizes growth over revenue and is what the network’s been in since launch in October 2020. To incentivize growth in a loss leadership model, grants via the Protocol Development Fund have been utilized for the majority of chain payments. Furthermore, rather than distributing these tokens to validators, they were instead paid to a growth pool and distributed to developers and builders. Thus far, revenue has only included ETH payments made by chain owners to cover the gas costs of running a SKALE chain.\nPhase 2 is planned to commence in Q3 and run for 6 months. It will introduce a temporary fixed chain cost of $3,200 per chain per month in SKL tokens. This figure aims to increase the fees distributed to validators, which can offset inflationary pressure, without creating too high of a financial burden for developers.\nPhase 3 will introduce a dynamic chain cost. It targets a yearly cost at a certain network load, initially proposed at $1 million per chain per year in SKL tokens with the network at a 70% load. Network load is defined here as the percentage of total validator resources in use across every SKALE chain. A higher network load leads to a higher cost and vice versa. This is planned to launch in Q2’24, subject to governance.\n\nOver time, subscription fees aim to replace inflation as the primary payment to validators. SKL has a fixed total supply, allocating one-third of the supply to validator rewards. So far, around 40% of this allocation has been distributed. At the end of Q2’23, SKL’s annualized inflation was at 6%, and this rate will continue to decline until all tokens are liquid.\n\nAdditionally, inflationary pressure comes from token unlocks to other buckets of SKL’s initial distribution. Genesis supply liquid measures the percentage of tokens from the initial distribution that are liquid, excluding tokens for staking rewards. By the end of Q2’23, SKALE’s genesis supply liquid was at 76.7%, with another 1.9% unlocking in Q3’23 to its core contributors.\n\nNetwork Security Costs and Incentives\n\nSKALE validator operations, including staking and rotation, occur on Ethereum via the SKALE manager smart contract. The SKALE manager runs distributed key generation (DKG) to generate Boneh–Lynn–Shacham (BLS) keys for each node. In the past five quarters, this computational cost has outweighed revenue generated, by 41 to 32 ETH.\n\nWhile the vast majority of validator rewards currently comes from inflation, SKL’s real yield has still been positive since not all tokens are staked. By the end of Q2’23, SKL’s real yield was 5%, a 34% QoQ increase. The increase was driven by the 14% QoQ decrease in the percentage of SKL tokens staked to 55%.\n\nToken-Based Governance\n\nOn the last day of Q2’23, a Snapshot vote to institute a proposed governance system passed, with 1.3 billion SKL voting affirmatively. The proposal was initially posted in SKALE’s forum by TheGreatAxios, the lead community developer for the Calypso NFT Hub. It allows SKL stakers to vote on governance proposals, whose scope will initially include network economic parameters such as subscription fees, inflation, slashing penalties, minimum stake requirements, and more. At the moment, the scope will not encompass more off-chain agendas such as grants, marketing, business development, etc., but it could be expanded to include these in the future. Beyond scope, the passed proposal also outlines the governance process and parameters. Notably, only SKL that is staked can participate in governance, which could reverse the downward trend in the percent of supply staked seen in Q2’23.\n\nVoting will occur on off-chain voting platform Snapshot. In order to execute proposals on-chain, the plan is to use SafeSnap, a Snapshot plugin that integrates Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) with Snapshot. With SafeSnap, passed proposals will need to be executed on-chain by the owners of the Safe multi-sig. The Safe owners also have veto power over a passed proposal.\n\nOverall, the goal for the new system was to start simple, get it up and running, and then add in more complexities via governance as needed.\n\nNetwork Analysis\n\nUsage\n\nThe number of SKALE chains remained at 20 throughout Q2’23, with no chains created or deleted. Combined across all SKALE chains, average daily transactions decreased 33% QoQ to 211,000. However, from Q2 start to end, daily transactions gradually trended upward. Chain-level activity is covered in the Ecosystem Section below.\n\nSecurity and Decentralization\n\nThe number of SKALE validators has remained steady at 53 in the past year with a current total of 125 active nodes in the network. SKL rewards are split evenly among all validators assuming they meet performance criteria. This creates an incentive for an entity to operate more than one validator. At the end of Q2, there were 34 entities running validators.\n\nSKALE validator nodes are segmented into up to 128 virtualized subnodes via a containerized architecture. A validator can have its various subnodes acting as validators for up to eight different SKALE chains. The pool of virtualized subnodes rotates among SKALE chains, with assignments set by the SKALE manager smart contract on Ethereum. In Q2’23, there was a large increase in the number of node rotations compared to previous quarters, with the number of DKG transactions almost doubling QoQ.\n\nTotal staked (SKL) decreased 7% QoQ to 2.5 billion, but SKL staked has largely remained constant over the past year. Thus, changes in total staked (USD) have mainly been driven by SKL price action. Total staked (USD) decreased 39% QoQ to $64 million. At quarter end, four validators made up the top 33% of SKL staked.\n\nUpgrades and Roadmap\n\nMetaport Bridge\n\nThe SKALE V2 upgrade in Q2’22 brought interoperability between SKALE chains. But the user and developer experience was not optimal. In Q2’23, the Metaport bridge launched, offering an easy-to-use interface on top of the underlying SKALE Interchain Messaging Agent (IMA) bridge. Metaport enables token transfers between SKALE chains as well as to and from Ethereum. Developers can integrate the",

It aims to become the \"Value Layer of the Internet\" and brings significant updates to protocol architecture, tokenomics, and governance.\nPolygon zkEVM experienced steady growth, showcasing notable collaborations and integrations with industry players. By the end of the quarter, it achieved 200,000 unique addresses.\nDespite a hostile U.S. regulatory environment, Polygon’s network fundamentals were unaffected by the news.\nPolygon expanded its list of collaborations with prominent legacy companies and institutions, including Franklin Templeton, Securitize, Mastercard, and Warner Music Group. These additions complement an existing roster that includes Adobe, Adidas, Disney, Meta, Nike, Reddit, Robinhood, and Starbucks.\n\nPrimer on Polygon\n\nPolygon is a suite of Ethereum-based scaling solutions that allow developers to move computation and data storage off Ethereum and into low-fee, high-speed development environments. Polygon offers the following solutions:\n\nPolygon PoS - Polygon’s flagship product is the Polygon PoS network, a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) EVM-compatible sidechain for the Ethereum network.\nPolygon zkEVM - A Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Layer-2 rollup protocol for Ethereum that launched on mainnet beta on March 27, 2023. Polygon zkEVM aims to enable secure, quick, and cheap transactions. As a ZK-rollup, Polygon zkEVM bundles transactions into batches that are executed off-chain.\nPolygon Miden - Polygon Miden is an upcoming Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Layer-2 rollup protocol designed for Ethereum. Setting itself apart from zkEVM, Polygon Miden does not rely on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Instead, it utilizes the Miden Virtual Machine (MVM), written in Rust. This unique approach allows developers to build high-throughput and private applications using modern smart contract languages like Rust, offering enhanced safety and aiming for minimal fees, all while benefiting from the security of the Ethereum network.\nPolygon Supernets - An app-chain-focused scaling solution for Polygon PoS that is in testnet. Polygon Supernets aim to expand the block space of Polygon PoS by providing both Layer-2 and Layer-3 networks for specific applications. Polygon Supernets are EVM-compatible, allowing applications built on Polygon PoS to achieve greater throughput and cheaper transaction costs.\nPolygon ID - A privacy-preserving identification service for Web3 users. Polygon ID uses ZK-proofs to verify a user’s credentials privately without disclosing unwanted personal information.\n\n  \nIn June 2023, Polygon Labs unveiled Polygon 2.0, a network of zero-knowledge Layer 2 blockchains. It aims to become the \"Value Layer of the Internet\" and brings significant updates to protocol architecture, tokenomics, and governance. Polygon 2.0 is the future of the Polygon ecosystem.\n\nWebsite / Twitter / Discord\n\nKey Metrics\n\nPolygon 2.0\n\nIntroduction\n\nPolygon 2.0 represents a significant milestone in the evolution of the Polygon blockchain, aimed at establishing it as the Value Layer of the Internet. This set of enhancements covers multiple areas including protocol architecture, tokenomics, and governance. The end goal is the democratization of global economic access, by boosting decentralized finance, digital ownership, and innovative coordination mechanisms. In this segment, we delve into the core attributes and consequences of Polygon 2.0 that have been revealed thus far.\n\nUnlimited Scalability and Unified Liquidity\n\nThe core vision of Polygon 2.0 is to enable unlimited scalability and unified liquidity through the integration of zero-knowledge (ZK) technology. This upgrade aims to address the inherent scaling challenges faced by Web3, where the addition of new chains often results in fragmented liquidity and an underwhelming user experience. By leveraging ZK-powered Layer-2 (L2) chains and a novel cross-chain coordination protocol, Polygon 2.0 creates a unified network that offers practically boundless scalability and seamless cross-chain interactions.\n\nPolygon PoS Upgrade to zkEVM Validium\n\nAs part of the Polygon 2.0 upgrade, it is proposed for the Polygon Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chain to transition into a zkEVM validium. This change enables Polygon PoS to enhance its security, performance, and compatibility within the Polygon 2.0 ecosystem. With zkEVM validium, transaction data is made available off-chain, resulting in lower fees compared to traditional rollups, while maintaining robust security guarantees. The proposed timeline for the upgrade is as follows:\n\nJune 2023 - July 2023: Pre-PIP discussion and consensus\nOctober 2023 - November 2023: PIP publishing, discussion, and consensus\nNovember 2023 - January 2024: PIP implementation and testing\nFebruary 2024 - March 2024: Upgrade, i.e., PIP activation on mainnet\n\nProtocol Architecture\n\nThe architecture of Polygon 2.0 is a key element in realizing its vision. It is organized into four protocol layers, each serving a specific purpose:\n\nStaking Layer - Leverages Polygon's native token to provide staking services to participating chains. The Staking Layer is implemented on Ethereum via two contracts: the Validator Manager and the Chain Manager.\nInterop Layer - Facilitates cross-chain messaging within the Polygon ecosystem. It enables secure shared access to native Ethereum assets and near-instant and atomic cross-chain transactions.\nExecution Layer - Handles block production and transaction sequencing.\nProving Layer - Incorporates a highly performant ZK proving protocol for generating and verifying proofs across Polygon chains.\n\nTokenomics\n\nPolygon Labs has proposed a new native token, POL, as part of the Polygon 2.0 upgrade. The new POL token will be a 1:1 upgrade of the existing MATIC token and will inherit MATIC’s 10 billion supply as its initial supply.\n\nPOL will enable holders to become validators for multiple Polygon chains and receive rewards for a variety of services. This includes standard validation services, such as accepting user transactions and determining their validity, as well as broader services, such as producing zk validity proofs for transactions or providing data availability guarantees. Notably, each individual Polygon chain can offer customized roles and rewards for its validators. Validators can choose to validate multiple chains at once to compound their rewards in a similar manner to EigenLayer’s restaking offering on Ethereum.\n\nFinally, Polygon’s new token economic model removes the finite 10 billion supply cap on its native token. Instead, POL will switch to an inflationary model to incentivize validator participation and fund a community-governed treasury. Both categories are expected to receive 1% POL inflation for the next 10 years until the community determines whether to drop the inflation rates.\n\nGovernance\n\nPolygon Governance 2.0 introduces three main governance pillars for the Polygon ecosystem. Protocol Governance, System Smart Contract Governance, and Community Treasury Governance. Each pillar of governance will have its own unique governance framework, aiming to create scalable and efficient governance mechanisms.\n\nProtocol Governance: Facilitated by the Polygon Improvement Proposal (PIP) framework, providing a platform for proposing upgrades to Polygon protocols.\nSystem Smart Contracts Governance: Addresses upgrades of protocol components implemented as smart contracts. The Ecosystem Council, governed by the community, will be responsible for these upgrades.\nCommunity Treasury Governance: Establishes a self-sustainable ecosystem fund, the Community Treasury, to support public goods and ecosystem projects. The governance process involves two phases, starting with an independent Community Treasury Board and evolving into community-driven decision-making.\n\nFinancial Overview\n\nMarket Capitalization and Revenue\n\nPolygon's market capitalization experienced a significant surge in <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-polygon-q1-2023?referrer=asset:polygon\">Q1 2023</a>, reaching nearly $14 billion in mid-February. Although it retraced some of the gains, Polygon closed Q1’23 with a market cap of $9.92 billion, marking a 50% increase compared to the previous quarter and outperforming the broader market.\n\nHowever, during the second quarter, Polygon's market cap declined to $5.82 billion, reflecting a 41% QoQ decrease. Despite the market cap contraction, Polygon’s market cap was still up year-over-year.\n\nPolygon generates revenue from network fees, which remained relatively stable QoQ at $11.4 million, equivalent to an annualized revenue of $57 million.\n\nNote: Polygon 2.0 will bring significant changes to Polygon’s revenue and value accrual. See the Polygon 2.0 - Unlimited Scalability and Unified Liquidity section for further details.\n\nMATIC Token\n\nPolygon's native token, MATIC, serves multiple functions within the network:\n\nUsed as payment for network gas fees (Native MATIC on Polygon PoS)\nUsed as a medium of exchange throughout the Polygon ecosystem (Native MATIC and MRC-20 WMATIC on Polygon PoS)\nStaked to operate a validator (ERC-20 MATIC on Ethereum)\nDelegated to a validator (ERC-20 MATIC on Ethereum)\nUsed to reward validators (ERC-20 MATIC on Ethereum)\nGovernance on the Heimdall layer (ERC-20 MATIC on Ethereum)\n\nIn October, MATIC reached <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-polygon-q4-2022?referrer=asset:polygon\">full vesting</a>, with a total supply of 10 billion tokens. MATIC follows the EIP-1559 upgrade, which includes a mechanism that burns) a portion of every network transaction fee paid in native MATIC. The \"base fee,\" a fluctuating portion of the gas fee, is burned, while the remaining fee is distributed to the block's proposing validator as a \"priority fee\" or tip. To date, a total of 16 million MATIC has been burned through this mechanism.\n\nNote: Polygon 2.0 will replace the MATIC token with a new token called POL. See the Polygon 2.0 - Toke",

      "content": "Key Insights\n\nFantom’s average daily active addresses declined by 18%, while new unique addresses grew by 146% QoQ. The growth in new addresses coincided with increased activity on LayerZero and Galxe.\nFantom's average daily transactions have steadily declined over the past year and decreased by 24.4% QoQ.\nLike most cryptoassets, Fantom’s market cap declined 36% QoQ after the SEC took regulatory actions against Coinbase and Binance.US, even though FTM was not alleged a security.\nProposal 34 was passed to reduce the minimum stake required to validate from 500,000 FTM to 50,000 FTM. The reduction aims to increase Fantom’s staking participation, grow its validator set, and facilitate greater decentralization.\nSeveral ecosystem growth initiatives have been established, including Fantom's recent Ecosystem Vault and Gas Monetization program, which started to build momentum in Q2 2023.\nFantom TVL denominated in USD dropped 46% QoQ. Towards the end of May, the DeFi ecosystem saw a significant decline in TVL when concerns about cross-chain router protocol, Multichain, surfaced.\nFantom has wide-reaching plans to remain competitive for the rest of 2023, including a new StateDB storage system, Fantom Virtual Machine (FVM), and account abstraction.\n\nPrimer on Fantom\n\nLaunched in 2018, Fantom is a Layer-1 protocol focused on fast and cost-efficient transaction execution. With developments pioneered by Andre Cronje, Fantom’s network hosts dozens of early DeFi protocols, including Curve, Yearn, and SushiSwap.\n\nFantom uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism, called Lachesis, which was created by the Fantom Foundation. Lachesis can provide security to multiple other layers, the first of which is Fantom's EVM-compatible smart contract chain, called Opera. Because Fantom nodes reach consensus independently, each node verifies transactions asynchronously and is not required to incorporate other blocks sequentially. This speeds-up transaction execution.\n\n<a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/fantom\">FTM</a>, the project's native token, is used for payments and governance. It also enables ongoing block rewards for validators and delegators who stake FTM. Fantom validators must stake a minimum of 50,000 FTM.\n\nWebsite / Twitter / Discord\n\nKey Metrics\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nNetwork Overview\n\nIn Q2’23, Fantom had ~44,000 average daily active addresses, down 18% QoQ. Despite the decrease, the metric was in line with the long-term trend of daily active addresses fluctuating around ~40,000 over the past year. However, Q4 2022 and Q1 2023 saw spikes in address activity that skewed the averages upwards.\n\nSimultaneously, average new unique addresses reached ~430,000 in Q2’23 (up 146% QoQ), which is the highest level over the past five quarters (up 6,110% YoY). This increase in new Fantom address activity coincided with increased activity from LayerZero, a lightweight, generalized cross-chain messaging protocol. LayerZero found some traction after LayerZero Labs developed Stargate, a bridge built on top of LayerZero. Among other things, Stargate avoids using wrapped tokens, increases user experience and capital efficiency, and removes attack vectors.\n\nAfter LayerZero announced its $120 million Series B fundraising on April 4, activity in terms of active wallets and transactions spiked on many of its supported networks. By June, Fantom was hosting 150,000-200,000 LayerZero and Stargate daily transactions and 100,000-150,000 daily unique addresses from those transactions.\n\nBeyond LayerZero, network activity was supported by Fantom’s leading DeFi application SpookySwap and credentialing data network Galxe. Galxe experienced noticeable traction with its reward-based loyalty programs which have been in effect on Fantom since Q4 2022.\n\nDespite the activity stemming from LayerZero and Galxe, Fantom's overall average daily transactions have steadily declined over the past year and decreased by 24.4% QoQ.\n\nWhile daily transactions trended downward, Fantom's average daily transaction fee (in FTM) increased by 86% QoQ. However, the average was skewed by a significant spike in April. This spike coincided with the activity stemming from LayerZero but was also driven by XEN Crypto, a free-to-mint token known for consuming gas on many networks.\n\nStaking and Decentralization\n\nFantom uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism called Lachesis. It provides security to multiple other layers, including Fantom's EVM-compatible smart contract chain, Opera.\n\nFantom nodes reach consensus independently. Because each node verifies transactions asynchronously and is not required to incorporate other blocks sequentially, Fantom’s consensus mechanism speeds up transaction execution. However, speed may come at the cost of decentralization.\n\nAs of Q2 2023, the state of Fantom's security and decentralization consisted of the following:\n\nActive validators - 61\nTotal staked - 1.3 billion FTM ( ~$400 million)\nNakamoto coefficient - 4\n\nFTM, the network's native token, can be used for ongoing block rewards sent to validators and delegators who stake FTM and secure the network. On April 2, 2023, Proposal 34 was passed to reduce the minimum FTM required to stake from 500,000 FTM to 50,000 FTM.\n\nFor networks to become more decentralized, they must increase the number of validators securing the network. By having more validators, a network makes it more difficult for malicious actors to compromise the network. With the passing of Proposal 34, the Fantom network is anticipated to increase its staking participation, grow its validator set, and facilitate greater decentralization.\n\nFinancial Overview\n\nAfter the value of FTM increased by 162% in Q1, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) put a damper on market sentiment during Q2 after it alleged that several exchanges (including Coinbase and Binance.US) engaged in unregistered offers and sales of cryptoasset securities. Even though FTM was not alleged a security, the complaint put downward pressure on FTM’s price, as it <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-l1s-q2-2023?referrer=all-research\">did for most cryptoassets</a>. As such, FTM experienced a sharp decline in June and finished the quarter down 36%.\n\nBeyond the circulating market cap, the circulating supply of FTM was flat QoQ after supply dynamics changed between Q4'22 and Q1'23. During Q4, Fantom's Ecosystem Vault and Gas Monetization program were introduced. They reduced the burn rate of transaction fees from 30% to 5% (more details in the Ecosystem section). At the same time, validator rewards remained constant.\n\nTo that end, Proposal 23 aimed to reduce the staking reward parameter and was passed in Q1. Consequently, validator rewards were reduced from ~14% to 6%, thereby decreasing the inflation rate that targets a ~2028 end date for rewards. Collectively, the circulating supply of FTM increased during Q1, but the network returned to its historical inflationary levels by the end of Q2. By June 30, 2023, over 10 million FTM (~0.3% of its 3.175 billion total supply) had been burned.\n\nRevenue in FTM (total transaction fees paid in FTM) increased by 35% (+22% in USD terms), while network value decreased by 36.1% QoQ. The increase in revenue was largely driven by the increase in average transaction fees brought on by XEN Crypto.\n\nNonetheless, the difference between the change in revenue versus market cap (in USD) suggests that value accrual from network activity was more significant than market behavior. The circulating market cap of FTM was 408x the annualized quarterly revenue at the end of Q1 2023 versus 214x at the end of Q2, suggesting a move to a more favorable valuation.\n\nWhile a P/S ratio may provide directional insight into fundamental value accrual versus speculative market behavior, it is not necessarily adequate for evaluating blockchain assets. Other valuation techniques have also been introduced, including Messari’s <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/layer-1-value-thesis-the-expected-demand-for-security-model?referrer=all-research\">Expected Demand for Security Model</a> and Multicoin’s Sum of the Parts framework.\n\nEcosystem and Development Overview\n\nEcosystem Growth Strategy\n\nIn addition to the Fantom Foundation's 30-year runway, several growth initiatives have been established. Of note, Fantom's recent Ecosystem Vault and Gas Monetization program both started to build momentum in Q2 2023.\n\nIn Q4 2022, the Fantom Foundation launched an Ecosystem Vault on Fantom, which introduced a decentralized funding process to support ecosystem builders. With the initiative, one-third of the 30% transaction fee burn rate (at the time) would be redirected to a Special Fee Contract (SFC). Through on-chain governance, validators can allocate funds from the SFC. Through Q2 2023, the Ecosystem Vault had amassed ~530,000 FTM, with no funding proposals yet approved. However, at the end of Q2, the Fantom Foundation introduced a new governance proposal to expedite the distribution of these funds using the Gitcoin Grants program.\n\nGitcoin Grants is a quadratic funding program created by Gitcoin. After community members donate tokens to participating projects in grant rounds, the program matches these donations through a funding allocation method known as quadratic funding. The more unique donations a project receives, the higher the matching funding will be. The first round of funding for Fantom projects began in Q1, with Fantom Foundation as the matching partner.\n\nIn Q4 2022, Fantom's Gas Monetization program was introduced to reduce the burn rate of the network's transaction fees from 20% to 5%. It also redirected the remaining 15% of the transaction fees to the Affiliate Rewards program, which rewards high-quality applications and offers sustainable income for developers. The proposal was passed in Q2, and Fantom's Gas Monetization program was launched in beta. By the end of Q2, more than a dozen applications joined the program, generating over 90,000 FTM in funding.\n\nOther growt",

      "content": "Key Insights\n\nBoba’s main focus is on gaming, NFTs, and metaverse via Hybrid Compute. Hybrid Compute is a key feature that allows developers to leverage existing Web2 tooling for more powerful computation and data usage.\nActivity on Boba BNB’s ROVI Network drove average daily transactions up 1,390% QoQ to 130,000. Boba BNB accounted for 99% of all Boba Network transactions.\nDespite a decrease in BOBA’s price, revenue (in USD) grew 90.5% QoQ due to increased transaction volume.\nBobabeam (Moonbeam) was deprecated in May.\n\nPrimer on Boba Network\n\nBoba Network is a Layer-2 multichain scaling solution with a focus on gaming. Boba operates on Ethereum, BNB, and Avalanche, and it is maintained by Enya Labs. As an optimistic rollup (OR) based on Optimism’s codebase, Boba offers:\n\nReduced gas fees\nIncreased transaction throughput\nL1 security guarantees\nEVM compatibility for smart contracts, such as NFTs and decentralized finance (DeFi)\n\nThis network also has unique features that set it apart from other ORs and Optimism forks:\n\nHybrid Compute — the ability to connect to off-chain computational resources, data, and APIs\nMultichain focus\nFast exit bridging to L1\nDAO governance\n\nBoba’s combination of features — specifically Hybrid Compute — enables decentralized applications (dapps) to:\n\nrun at a fraction of the cost of L1 dapps\nleverage off-chain computation via Web2 APIs, and\nprovide the multichain solutions needed for blockchain gaming.\n\nBoba Network was previously active on Fantom and Moonbeam, but those implementations have since been deprecated.\n\nWebsite / Twitter / Discord\n\nKey Metrics\n\nThe quantitative data in this report focuses on the Ethereum, BNB, and Avax implementations of Boba Network unless stated otherwise. Bobabeam (Moonbeam) wound down during Q2, so it has been excluded.\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nNetwork Overview\n\nNetwork activity on Boba Network was a mixed bag in Q2. Average daily transactions was the standout metric, increasing 1,390% QoQ from 8,700 to 130,000. ROVI Network, a multi-purpose “super app,” was responsible for this drastic increase (more details in the Ecosystem Overview section). Despite this massive increase in overall transactions, daily active addresses declined 18.8% QoQ. ROVI Network’s forwarder executes transactions on behalf of users that transact gaslessly, so it barely affects the unique contract callers metric.\n\nBoba BNB quickly found adoption with various types of dapps, leading Boba implementations in nearly all activity metrics. In Q2, Boba BNB had 65.9% active address dominance.\n\nROVI Network is overwhelmingly responsible for the increase in transaction activity in Q2. Boba BNB reached 1 million cumulative transactions in April. By the end of Q2, Boba BNB had processed 12.5 million cumulative transactions. For reference, Boba Ethereum has processed just over 1 million transactions since deployment in 2021. ROVI Network was responsible for 11.78 million of 11.83 total transactions in Q2.\n\nThe average transaction fee decreased 86.6% QoQ to $0.0054, roughly half a cent. This was primarily due to increased transaction dominance by Boba BNB, which had much lower fees than Boba Ethereum.\n\nFinancial Overview\n\nBOBA’s price declined 45.0% QoQ, lagging behind the total crypto market cap’s increase of 0.4%. BOBA is the native asset of Boba Network, and its primary use case is settling network fees.\n\nRevenue (in BOBA) is measured as total L2 fees minus total L1 sequencer fees. It grew 246.6% QoQ to 238,600 BOBA, but denominated in USD, revenue grew 90.5% QoQ. This increase came primarily from Boba BNB, as the high transaction volume brought in more L2 fees as L1 sequencer fees stayed relatively stable.  \n\nEcosystem Overview\n\nAverage daily contract calls increased by nearly 1,400% in Q2; this metric is heavily attributed to “super app” ROVI Network. Unique contract callers and unique contracts called declined 25.0% and 1.5% QoQ, respectively. Due to the architecture of ROVI Network, increased user interaction only scales the total contract calls metric and not unique contracts or contract caller metrics. ROVI Network’s forwarder contract affects contract call metrics the same way it affects active address metrics, skewing them downwards.\n\nWhile Boba Ethereum lost dominance in terms of daily active addresses, its established ecosystem dating back to 2021 continued to have many more dapps and contracts than Boba BNB or Boba Avax. This relationship may explain the disproportionate 63% dominance of unique contracts called on Boba Ethereum in Q2, as users have more options to interact with.\n\nThe major increase in total contract calls starting in February 2022 came from the same addresses becoming more active, specifically ROVI Network’s forwarder contract. Boba BNB is responsible for the majority of daily unique contract callers (76.5% dominance) and total contract calls (99.6% dominance) in Q2.\n\nROVI Network\n\nROVI Network is a multi-purpose infrastructure app that drives the majority of transaction activity on Boba BNB and the Boba Network as a whole. ROVI offers a social recovery wallet, an on/off ramp, and gasless transactions to create a familiar UX for both Web3 and Web2 users. Its token, which has 27,000 holders, is used for rewards and staking.\n\nROVI calls itself a “super app” because it packages many features into a single solution, like WeChat for the blockchain. ROVI integrates crypto through several pieces of infrastructure.\n\nMessaging, such as with existing platforms WhatsApp and Telegram, via Keyboard91.\nFinancial services, such as payments, trading crypto, and earning yield on stables, via M91 Super App.\nGaming, via Gaming91.\n\nIn Q2, three ROVI contracts accounted for 99.9% of all Boba BNB transactions:\n\nThe ROVI Forwarder contract had 6.1 million transactions addressed to it\nThe M91 token contract had 5.0 million transactions addressed to it\nThe ROVI token contract had 0.7 million transactions addressed to it\n\nGaming\n\nMegaWorld launched in Q1’23 and continued to ship new features from its extensive roadmap. One upcoming game is Katana Inu, a player-versus-player (PvP) battle royale game that incorporates NFTs and fungible tokens. The team has released a demo and is working towards its PC beta launch. Homie Wars, a mobile-first, metaverse, battle-to-earn game, launched in Q2. Other games on Boba Network include METAFORRA, Cosmic Universe, and EvoVerses.\n\nNFTs\n\nMany games in development on Boba Network, such as Cosmic Universes, EvoVerses, and Katana Inu, plan to integrate NFTs into gameplay. Boba will likely experience more NFT activity as games approach their respective mainnets.\n\nCosmic Universe is working towards its pre-alpha phase, which will include integrations for the more than 10,000 existing character and land NFTs.\n\nDeFi\n\nTVL (USD) declined for the fifth consecutive quarter, down 17.0% QoQ to $3.4 million. Boba Ethereum still accounted for the vast majority of Boba Network TVL with over 90% dominance. Its dominance is largely due to Boba BNB and Boba Avax being relatively new (deployed in H2 2022) and Boba Network fully pivoting to becoming a gaming chain. As a gaming chain, TVL is not as representative a metric for the overall state of the ecosystem as it is with many other chains.\n\nSushiSwap, an AMM dex, ended Q2 with:\n\n48% dominance over Boba Ethereum TVL\n36% dominance over Boba BNB TVL\n95% dominance over Boba Avax TVL\n47% dominance over combined Boba Network TVL\n\nOolongSwap, the first native DEX on Boba, and Symbiosis, a cross-chain AMM and bridge, are the second and third largest DeFi protocols, respectively, with 22% and 10% TVL dominance. Symbiosis completed its cross-promotion with Rubic to airdrop Galxe NFTs to users in April.\n\nQualitative Analysis\n\nKey Events\n\nNoteworthy events from Q2 include:\n\nBobabeam was deprecated in May. Bobabeam did not host much activity, so development resources were reallocated to the other implementations.\nBoba Network’s $1 million bug bounty was updated to include a broader scope of submissions.\nWitnet deployed a decentralized oracle on Boba BNB.\nNOWPayments integrated BOBA metaverse payments.\nEnjinstarter announced a partnership with Enya Labs to bring a launchpad to the network.\nPetobots, a PvP game, is being developed.\nCaesar’s Temple, a play-to-earn metaverse game, is being developed.\n\nMultichain Approach\n\nBobabeam wound down and was deprecated on May 25. Bobabeam was Boba Network’s Layer-2 scaling solution on Moonbeam and the first of its kind in the ecosystem. This move was made to give additional focus to more active Boba Network implementations.\n\nAs newer implementations see more activity, they also receive adoption from ecosystem tools. Covalent and DefiLlama now support Boba BNB and Boba Avax, in addition to Boba Ethereum, which they’ve supported its launch in 2021.\n\nHybrid Compute and Gaming\n\nBoba Network aims to be the leading solution for gaming and metaverse applications via its Hybrid Compute feature. This feature intends to solve the problem of closed-off blockchain ecosystems. As it stands, blockchains cannot use any data or compute from outside of their ecosystem without an API or oracle. With Hybrid Compute, developers can:\n\nCreate advanced algorithms that are typically too expensive to run on-chain.\nGet millisecond response times.\nGenerate random numbers and other resources that typically carry security concerns in decentralized computational environments.\nAccess low-cost storage, image, and audio processing.\nConnect to external gaming services such as Unreal Engine.\nInstantly mint NFTs based on game activity.\nView offchain price feeds (e.g., CoinGecko) to create variable pricing/actions.\n\nWith Hybrid Compute, developers can leverage legacy Web2 systems and solutions to build higher-quality blockchain games. For example, Boba Avax adopted Avalanche games such as METAFORRA, Cosmic Universe, and EvoVerses, which can now leverage off-chain compute and Web2 APIs.\n\nThe Layer-2 Landscape\n\nArbitrum and Optimism, fello",

      "content": "Key Insights:\n\nAs of Q2'23, 1,082 subgraphs have been published from The Graph’s hosted service to the decentralized network (mainnet), up 39% QoQ.\nThe ongoing L2 migration of The Graph’s protocol smart contracts to Arbitrum aims to bring a seamless and gas-efficient decentralized data experience to The Graph’s users.\nIn Q2'23, The Graph saw a 48% QoQ decrease in demand-side revenue in USD, driven by dapps optimizing query volumes and an overall reduction in usage from governance activities and decentralized infrastructure.\nRevenue from indexing rewards increased 3% QoQ to over 9 million USD in Q2’23. Delegators received 64% of the total indexing rewards distributed in Q2’23.\nFollowing the MIPs incentive program, The Graph's active Indexers decreased 29% QoQ, while Delegators and Curators grew 2% and 3%, respectively.\n\nPrimer on The Graph\n\nThe Graph is an indexing protocol that provides on-chain data to consumers from a wide spectrum of sources. It removes the need for data consumers (e.g., app developers) to build out complicated infrastructure to get on-chain data. Instead, data consumers pay to query APIs of on-chain data — called “subgraphs” — via the GraphQL API.\n\nTo ensure the protocol runs correctly and efficiently, The Graph network incentivizes several key roles within its ecosystem of both technical and non-technical participants:\n\nIndexers process and store on-chain data from subgraphs. They usually have advanced technical knowledge to operate nodes. In return, Indexers receive query fees from data consumers and indexing rewards from new token issuance.\nCurators are economically incentivized to analyze and signal which subgraphs are valuable to index. Curators earn a 10% portion of the query fees generated by particular subgraphs.\nDelegators do not employ resources to index on-chain data; instead, they delegate The Graph's native utility token <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/the-graph\">GRT</a> to Indexers. In return, Delegators earn a portion of query fees and indexing rewards without running nodes themselves.\n\nAs of Q2’23, seven networks are supported by The Graph's decentralized protocol and hosted service: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Fantom, Gnosis Chain, and Celo. The L2 <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/0e25b254-7788-45dd-99d7-0e6271ea2585\">migration</a> of The Graph’s protocol smart contracts to Arbitrum is ongoing.\n\nKey Metrics\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nThe Graph Network is based on the relationship between subgraph developers and data consumers (e.g., app developers) that pay to query subgraph data. The performance of the network can be measured by the growth of active subgraphs, the network's revenue in query fees, and the activity of Indexers, Delegators, and Curators.\n\nUsage (Subgraphs)\n\nTo bootstrap The Graph, a hosted service was initially created. This service hosts subgraphs as the protocol gradually transitions to its decentralized network (mainnet). The hosted service is free (subsidized by The Graph ecosystem) and consists of indexing infrastructure run by Edge & Node, the initial team behind The Graph. The first subgraph launched on the mainnet in Q1'21. As of Q2'23, The Graph is a hybrid of its hosted service and mainnet.\n\nOver the past five quarters, the number of subgraphs launched on mainnet has grown steadily. As of June 2023, there are 1,082 active subgraphs on mainnet, which is a 39% increase QoQ. Unlike the hosted service, The Graph Network requires data consumers to pay a fee per query to Indexers. These query fees are further distributed by Indexers to Delegators and Curators.\n\nSource: The Graph Explorer\n\nCurators are incentivized to signal subgraphs that are of a high quality. The Graph then indexes these subgraphs to earn a share of the query fees generated by subgraphs. The amount of GRT signaled toward a subgraph represents the market’s prediction for future query volume on a subgraph. Curators currently signal the highest amount of GRT toward the Premia, Livepeer, and RAI subgraphs.\n\nOver the next several quarters, the number of deployed subgraphs on The Graph Mainnet is expected to increase. The Graph community aims to migrate all subgraphs from the hosted service to its mainnet, as more chains integrate with the decentralized network. During the migration, other key metrics on The Graph should also improve, ranging from ecosystem participation to the demand-side revenue generated from query fees.\n\nEcosystem Participation\n\nSubgraphs provide an arena for both technical and non-technical ecosystem participants to interact symbiotically:\n\nIndexers operate Graph Nodes to process and store on-chain data. Data consumers can then query this data via GraphQL, an open-source language for The Graph’s APIs.\nCurators signal to Indexers which subgraphs are worth indexing. Curators also often act as subgraph developers.\nDelegators are ecosystem participants who may lack the technical know-how or resources to index; they may choose to delegate GRT to Indexers.\n\nStaked GRT is required for indexing subgraphs. As Indexers receive more GRT via delegation, they increase their capacity to index a larger number of subgraphs on the network. Indexers monetize their indexing and query processing services on The Graph's query market by staking GRT. The minimum stake for an Indexer is currently set to 100,000 GRT (roughly $10,000 as of June 30, 2023). On top of this minimum, Indexers can also receive delegated stake from other ecosystem participants. Delegators can increase their total stake up to 16x an Indexer's personal stake.  \n\nBoth Delegators and Curators saw 2% and 3% growth, respectively. However, Indexers actively staking GRT decreased for the first time in the past five quarters, down 29% to 328 at the end of Q2’23. This decrease can be attributed to the conclusion of The Graph’s Multi-Chain Incentivized Program (MIP) at the end of Q1’23 as well as to some Indexers simultaneously un-staking their GRT. This behavior hints at the potential dependency of Indexers on reward incentives as they seek to balance operating costs and accruing revenue from staking GRT and servicing queries on The Graph’s network.\n\nAt the end of Q2’23, there were 653 Indexers that either allocated or were continuing to allocate their own stake towards their subgraphs to earn staking rewards. That is, besides the 328 actively staking GRT (i.e., were active), 325 were inactive in Q2’23. It remains to be seen to what extent some of these inactive Indexers will start actively staking GRT again over the next quarters, anticipating the migration of more subgraphs to the mainnet. The migration would not only bring in more indexing opportunities but, in turn, also more revenue from indexing rewards.\n\nRevenue\n\nThe GRT token follows the <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/how-are-web3-infrastructure-protocols-trying-to-capture-value\">Stake-for-Access model</a>, also known as a utility token model. Participants in The Graph's ecosystem earn revenue in GRT by performing work in the form of indexing and querying services on the mainnet. Both services require GRT to be staked. Indexers' stake comprises their own GRT tokens (i.e., self-stake) and GRT delegated toward them (i.e., delegated stake).\n\nThe two main sources of revenue for The Graph are indexing rewards and query fees paid by data consumers. Revenue from both indexing rewards and query fees is funneled through Indexers who then distribute it to Delegators and Curators.\n\nEvery Indexer is free to define their own individual cut of query fees and indexing rewards, based on the supply-and-demand dynamics of the open marketplace. According to this individual cut, each Indexer then distributes the revenue as follows: query fees are shared with Curators, whereas both indexing rewards and query fees are shared with Delegators.\n\nSource: The Graph: Choosing Indexers\n\nAs per the above example, if an Indexer set the query fee cut to 13.96%, their Delegators would receive the remaining 86.04% of the fee revenue proportional to their stake. While Delegators' stake cannot be slashed, Delegators should still consider several factors when staking GRT with Indexers. These factors relate to:\n\nIndexer choice, i.e., choosing effective Indexers with the most optimal balance between reward payouts and “skin-in-the-game” from allocation of self-stake.\nUnbonding period, i.e., no GRT transfers or rewards are possible within a 28-day window after un-delegation.\nDelegation tax of 0.5%, i.e., calculating how long it takes to earn back the 0.5% tax on delegation.\n\nIndexing Rewards\n\nIndexing rewards come from a 3% annual inflation in the GRT supply, derived from the GRT issuance rate. Rewards are distributed to staked Indexers in return for providing indexing and querying services on The Graph’s open marketplace.\n\nIndexing rewards grew 3% QoQ to approximately $9.1 million in Q2’23. In GRT terms, indexing rewards remained relatively stable, up 1% QoQ from 71 million GRT in Q1’23 to 72 million GRT in Q2’23. This stability is a consequence of the <a href=\"https://messari.io/governor/proposal/66983cb4-afe2-443f-9d7b-17217dd2b686?daoSlug=the-graph-governance&daoTab=proposals\">governance decision</a> to set the protocol issuance rate back to The Graph’s original 3% prior to The Merge in September 2022. For context, following The Merge, the number of blocks created on Ethereum increased. As a result, the GRT rewards issued per block increased to 3.2% for approximately one month in Q4’22, which led the overall quarterly rewards to reach 80 million GRT in Q4’21, before decreasing ever since.\n\nOver the past five quarters, Delegators received more GRT indexing rewards than Indexers themselves. In Q2'23 alone, Delegators were rewarded over 46 million GRT (roughly $5.7 million). This amounted to approximately 64% of the total indexing rewards distributed, up from 62% in Q1’23. Delegators may have received more rewards as Indexers focused on attracting more delegated stake by offering a more ",

      "content": "Key Insights\n\nThe Sandbox experienced QoQ increases in nominal activity around total NFT mints (+59%), total primary sales (+52%), and total active buyers (+22%).\nThe 30% increase in non-LAND primary sale volume and 18% rise in ESTATE volume anchored total revenue into only a 15% QoQ fall while five other revenue metrics fell by over 25%.\nThe SEC filed lawsuits against Coinbase and Binance in which they took the position that a number of cryptocurrencies and tokens, including SAND, were securities. In addition, the outcome of SEC v. Ripple Labs will likely impact ongoing and future crypto regulation in the U.S.\nThe Sandbox partnered with brands like Paris Hilton, Cipriani, Warner Music, Marathon City, Metafight, and Playground. Several other brands and companies also focused on building virtual experiences in the Web3 industry.\nAccording to The Sandbox roadmap, it plans to release new features such as the ability to self-publish experiences on the map by the end of Q3. It will also enable users to create ESTATEs and rent/lease LANDs and ESTATEs in Q4 2023.\n\nPrimer on The Sandbox\n\nThe Sandbox is a gaming metaverse where players and creators can make 3D assets and experiences (e.g. games) that can be monetized via NFTs. The tokenized and gaming features leveraged by The Sandbox are listed below.\n\nSAND — an ERC-20 token and digital in-game currency used for purchases, monetization, and asset creation\nLAND — digital ownable land within The Sandbox virtual world\nESTATE — a combination of LANDs to create a larger plot\nASSET — assets created using the VoxEdit application that are converted to ERC-1155 tokens when uploaded to The Sandbox marketplace\nGEM — tokens burnt to give attributes to ASSETs\nCATALYST — tokens burnt to define an ASSETs tier/scarcity\nGame Maker — a toolbox that enables users to create 3D games and experiences in The Sandbox virtual world\n\nThe Sandbox provides Mindcraft-esque gameplay with digital ownership and more robust in-game economics due to the tradeable nature of the SAND token and the other assets within the Sandbox virtual world.\n\nSandbox offers a variety of in-game NFTs as well as user-generated NFTs. The VoxEdit NFT builder is used for creating 3D objects (ASSETs) such as characters, equipment, wearables, and art.\n\nThe Sandbox was initially launched as a 2D mobile game in 2012 by the software development company Pixowl. Pixowl was founded in 2011 by Arthur Madrid and Sebastien Borget. The mobile game iteration of Sandbox accumulated more than 40 million downloads by April 2018. In May 2018, The Sandbox rebranded as a 3D metaverse game and blockchain-focused development began. In August 2018, Pixowl and The Sandbox were acquired by Animoca Brands, a gaming-focused software development company and VC Fund.\n\nWebsite / Twitter / Discord\n\nKey Metrics\n\nQ2 2023 saw the recovery of active non-LAND buyers, non-LAND minted, and LAND minted after a universal fall in The Sandbox’s key network metrics (except for SAND staked) in the previous quarter. While the daily average SAND staked continued to increase QoQ, it dropped as a percentage of the SAND supply due to more SAND unlocking and entering the circulating supply.\n\nRegarding financials, the 30% increase in non-LAND primary sale volume and 18% increase in ESTATE volume anchored revenue — thus, total revenue only fell 15% QoQ while the five other revenue metrics fell by over 25%. As non-LAND primary sale volume increased, it surpassed private LAND sales in dominance and accounted for 37% of total revenue (up from 24% the previous quarter).\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nUnique Active Buyers\n\nUnique active buyers measures the number of distinct wallets purchasing LAND and non-LAND assets.\n\nActivity on The Sandbox is conducted through digital real estate called LAND NFTs. As such, LAND is valued for its fundamental role. Non-LAND NFTs are valued lower, though they are still necessary in The Sandbox metaverse for various types of activities (e.g., CATALYSTS to create ASSETS and GEMS to give attributes to ASSETS).\n\nWith a difference in general monetary value, LAND is harder to acquire (at a 0.28 ETH floor on OpenSea as of writing), lowering the buyer pool. Non-LAND assets are priced lower (at a 0.0001 ETH floor on OpenSea as of writing), enabling a larger pool of buyers. These differences are accentuated by poor market conditions, which may contribute to the number of active LAND buyers continuing to fall (–10% QoQ) and to active non-LAND buyers increasing (+30% QoQ).\n\nTotal Primary Sale Volume\n\nThe total primary sale volume measures the USD amounts for which assets from The Sandbox were sold. The Sandbox company retains the earnings from primary sales.\n\nThough total LAND sale volume eclipsed non-LAND primary sales, non-LAND primary sale volume grew by 30% and was greater than any individual LAND sale type. Throughout Q2’23, users could mint different non-LAND assets from various notable collections like Hell’s Kitchen and Paris Hilton, which also held events throughout the quarter.\n\nSecondary Sale Volume & Royalty Revenue\n\nThe secondary sale volume measures the USD amounts for which assets from The Sandbox were sold on secondary exchanges like OpenSea and LooksRare. The Sandbox company retains a 5% royalty on the secondary sale volume.\n\nLAND continued to dominate secondary sale volume even as the LAND floor price dropped, going from above 0.5 ETH at the start of April to under 0.4 ETH by the end of June. Regardless, both LAND and non-LAND assets have suffered secondary trading declines throughout each quarter over the past year. While the drop in floor price can contribute to lower volume, the ongoing poor market conditions may have also suppressed secondary activity.\n\nTotal Revenue\n\nTotal revenue is the sum of the total primary sale volume and total royalty revenue. Royalty revenue is 5% of the total secondary sale volume.\n\nHistorically, revenue accruing to The Sandbox largely came from LAND sales (with a couple exceptions). This quarter added another exception as non-LAND primary sales accounted for 37% of the total revenue accrued to The Sandbox. The rise in non-LAND primary sale dominance came amidst QoQ declines in non-LAND royalty (–28%) and LAND royalty (–42%), private (–40%), auction (–50%), and primary sales (–29%). The increases in non-LAND primary sale volume (30%+) and ESTATE volume (+18%) led the total revenue to only decline by 15% QoQ.\n\nDaily Average SAND Staked\n\nSAND staked as a percentage of the circulating supply is included to observe what percentage of SAND staking makes SAND illiquid and temporarily impervious to sell pressure.\n\nDaily SAND staked continues to grow with a 5% increase QoQ. Though the amount of SAND staked has increased, SAND staked as a percentage of the circulating supply fell by 2% QoQ due to the 3% QoQ of the circulating supply. Although more SAND has been staked nominally throughout each quarter over the past year, the amount of newly unlocked SAND has released more liquid SAND into the economy. The added liquid SAND could be placing more sell pressure on the SAND token.\n\nSAND Staking Rewards\n\nSAND staking is conducted on the Polygon network and involves two staking pools: one for LAND owners and one for everyone else. LAND owners can stake up to 2,000 SAND per LAND asset in this pool. In the other pool, any SAND holder can stake their SAND, though LAND owners receive a multiplier based on the number of LANDs they own. In total, both pools distribute 150,000 SAND per week.\n\nSAND staking rewards show the aggregate amount in USD that users staking the SAND token earned. It is contrasted with price to show the often-weighted relationship. SAND staking rewards in USD terms are also affected by the amount of SAND rewards in SAND.\n\nIn Q2’23, staking rewards fell by 48% in SAND and 57% in USD terms. While rewards have been declining in USD terms throughout the past year, Q3’22 and Q4’22 saw roughly 30% QoQ increases in SAND rewards. Users seeking rewards by staking SAND appear to be more affected by the USD price of SAND than the nominal SAND rewarded. The distribution of SAND from staking only accounts for less than 0.2% of new SAND entering the market, making the sell pressure from SAND staking rewards negligible. Price appears to be largely a consequence of market trends in the gaming sector.\n\nSAND FDV\n\nChanges in fully diluted valuation (FDV) reflect an asset’s price. Moreover, tracking FDV complements price volatility with a sense of scale for the asset’s significance.\n\nSAND’s fully diluted valuation has yet to drop below $1.1 billion. In Q2’23, it hovered between $2.1 billion and $1.1 billion. Regardless, SAND’s FDV ended at $1.22 billion, only 1% higher than at the start of 2023. From the start to the end of Q2’23, SAND’s price dropped by 35%. This drop in the price of SAND follows the general trend of the gaming market in crypto. The three next largest gaming tokens also experienced similar falls in price, with MANA declining by 36%, AXS by 30%, and GALA by 41% throughout the quarter.\n\nQualitative Analysis\n\nThroughout Q2’23, The Sandbox held events, announced new partnerships and integrations, and updated its future roadmap. Despite mixed signals on the regulatory front, The Sandbox remains focused on building out and improving its gaming ecosystem.\n\nNotable Events, Partnerships, and Integrations\n\nThe Sandbox ecosystem continues to grow with new partnerships and integrations being announced in Q2 2023. Many projects have partnered with The Sandbox to offer customized metaverse experiences to its users, and several notable ones are listed below.\n\nFitness Brands — Gym Aesthetics, Salsation, Go24, Cycliq, Stages, Playinnovation, Trib3, and Myzone.\nDanceFight — A renowned dance battle app, released an exclusive avatar collection on The Sandbox based on 10 of the world’s top street dancers.\nMarathon City — Launching a metaverse experience-themed “Nipsey Hussle’s Universe” to honor the Late rapper’s legacy.\nCipriani — Ann",

      "title": "State of Hedera Q2 2023",
      "content": "Key Insights\n\nCOFRA became the 29th member of the Hedera Governing Council. The Council consists of organizations that are dedicated to advancing the growth and development of Hedera, which includes operating Hedera's validator nodes.\nThere was consistent growth and adoption across all Hedera Network Services. The Hedera Consensus Service is the fastest growing of the Network Services.\nThe increase in Hedera network usage was primarily driven by NFTs. This is a shift from previous quarters where DeFi was the main driver.\nHedera announced a strategy for EVM equivalence. A key contribution to this strategy has been made by Swirlds Labs, which developed a Hedera-specific JSON-RPC Relay codebase, known as Hashio. This will pave the way for Solidity and Vyper smart contracts functionality on the Hedera network.\n\nPrimer on Hedera\n\nHedera is a public-permissioned leaderless Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchain network. It is governed by 29 global organizations, known as the Hedera Governing Council, with input from the community via Hedera Improvement Proposals (HIPs). Members of the Governing Council operate Hedera’s validator nodes while the network transitions to permissionless node hosting. Although Hedera's network operation is currently permissioned in nature, the division of responsibility across each of the 29 geographically and industry diversified (collusion-proof) council members is unique among public DLTs. This governance structure physically prevents aggregation of hash rate or stake to the same point that is threatening the security of other public ledgers.\n\nHedera offers developers core services, known as the Hedera Network Services, to build decentralized applications. The network is powered by the Hashgraph Consensus Algorithm, which offers high throughput, fair ordering, and low-latency consensus.\n\nWebsite / Twitter / Discord\n\nKey Metrics\n\nFinancial Overview\n\nMarket Capitalization and Revenue\n\nIn Q2 2023, Hedera's market capitalization dropped by 22%, reaching $1.54 billion. The decline in market capitalization was influenced by external factors, including the SEC's complaints against <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/e1fbfd61-f6af-412d-a1c4-9deea7a883bd\">Binance</a> and <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/79ad00d4-9b49-40b0-b3e2-6173bd08863d\">Coinbase</a>. Hedera ended Q2 ranked as the thirty-second largest crypto protocol by market capitalization.\n\nHedera's revenue, which represents the total fees spent on the network, experienced a significant increase of 67% QoQ, rising from $476,000 to $794,000. This growth in revenue was primarily driven by the surge in activity within the Hedera Consensus Service.\n\nHBAR Token\n\nHBAR, Hedera's native token, serves multiple purposes within the network. It is utilized for paying network gas fees, paying Hedera Network Services fees, delegating to validators, and securing the network In the future, Hedera will also enable staking for operating permission-less public validators and rewarding validators.\n\nHBAR has a maximum total supply of 50 billion. As of the end of Q2, 32.2 billion HBAR, representing 64% of the total supply, was in circulation. The <a href=\"https://messari.io/asset/hedera-hashgraph/profile/supply-schedule\">distribution</a> of HBAR occurs quarterly through the Hedera Treasury, following a schedule that extends until 2025. In Q3 2023, another 3.7% of the HBAR total supply will be unlocked to support ecosystem programs, investors, and core contributors.\n\nNetwork Overview\n\nUsage\n\nDuring the second quarter of 2023, Hedera experienced consistent and substantial growth in terms of account-related figures. Year to date, there has been a rise of 288% in Hedera's average daily active accounts, growing from 3,500 to 13,500 by Q2 2023. Concurrently, there was a 340% jump in the average daily creation of new accounts, growing from 2,300 to 10,200 in the same period.\n\nThe upsurge in account-related metrics during Q4 2022 and <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-hedera-q1-2023?referrer=asset:hedera-hashgraph\">Q1 2023</a> was largely due to the introduction of new Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs) on the network. In contrast, the growth spurt in Q2 2023 was propelled by NFTs. The main driver of NFT activity was Karateka, which launched its KARATE token, mobile application, and NFT collection.\n\nAnalogous to the growth in account-related statistics, Hedera's transaction activity has experienced a multi-fold surge since Q4 2022. By Q2 2023, Hedera was processing an average of 72 million transactions on a daily basis. Notably, the Hedera Consensus Service contributes 99% to this total transaction count. Hedera Consensus Service transactions are transaction-based and do not log consensus-related events.\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe Hedera ecosystem has invested in product launches and partnerships over the past few quarters to bolster developer activity on its network. These include:\n\nIn February 2022, the introduction of Smart Contracts 2.0. This update brought in EVM compatibility, support for Solidity-based smart contracts, and core Ethereum tooling, leading to consistent growth of the service.\nIn Q1 2023, Arkhia unveiled a complete suite of developer tools that facilitates the development and deployment of smart contracts on the network.\n\nThe focus on developers was carried into Q2 2023 with several key initiatives:\n\nA partnership between the HBAR Foundation and Tribe to host a series of educational programs, helping developers to understand and construct in Web3.\nJoget Inc, a firm specializing in open-source no-code/low-code platforms, introduced the Hashgraph Application Studio, simplifying decentralized application development within the Hedera ecosystem.\nTuum Technologies released Identity Snap on Metamask, an advanced plugin for developers aiming to develop Digital Identifiers (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs) on Hedera.\nA collaborative effort with Google Cloud’s Web3 startup program, where Hedera offers numerous benefits to startups, such as up to $200,000 USD in Google Cloud credits over two years, funding from The HBAR Foundation, technical and collaboration support, early access to Google Cloud Web3 products and roadmap, as well as access to learning labs, Google Cloud courses, and Web3 community events.\n\nThe most significant developer announcement in Q2 was the reveal of Hedera's strategy for achieving Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) equivalence. The team provided insights into their approach for amalgamating the HyperLedger Besu EVM client with Hedera's native services. This integration will bring the functionality of Solidity and Vyper smart contracts to the Hedera network.\n\nSwirlds Labs has made a significant contribution to this process by developing an open-source Hedera-specific JSON-RPC Relay codebase. The Swirlds Labs “community service” implementation is named Hashio, and commercial providers Arkhia and Validation Cloud are providing commercial offerings for JSON-RPC. This innovation facilitates the integration of existing EVM development environments and wallets with the Hedera platform. Moreover, Hedera has successfully merged its native services, such as the Hedera Token Service and Hedera Consensus Service, into the EVM.\n\nThrough the first half of 2023, Hedera is averaging 150 daily active smart contracts.\n\nGoverning Council\n\nThe Hedera Governing Council is a group of organizations dedicated to supporting the growth and development of Hedera, including the operation of Hedera validator nodes. In Q1, the Council welcomed its 28th member, Dell Technologies. In Q2, the Council welcomed its 29th member, COFRA. With a maximum of 39 members, each holding an equal vote in Hedera's decision-making process, the Council aims for balanced governance.\n\nAs Hedera's network expands, Hedera anticipates more public nodes to bolster its infrastructure. Council members serve three-year terms, limited to two consecutive terms, and possess equal voting rights on network and platform decisions. Swirlds, the creator of Hashgraph, maintains a permanent Council seat but lacks additional privileges. The Council primarily focuses on governance for network stability and Hedera Treasury management.\n\nThe Council holds a monthly meeting and publishes minutes from the meeting:\n\nApril meeting - The Council members approved the COFRA Group as the 29th Council member and the March 8, 2023 meeting minutes and voted to form the Marketing Committee, contingent upon Council’s election of two Marketing Committee Co-Chairs, and approved the Marketing Committee’s charter as presented at the meeting.\nMay meeting - Hosted in-person at Google’s headquarters, the Council members approved the April 12, 2023 meeting minutes and the allocation of 3.735 billion HBAR to fulfill existing contractual obligations for token purchase agreements, network governance and operations, and ecosystem and open-source development and voted to appoint Shuchi Rana and Ian Jebbit as Co-Chairs of the Marketing Committee, with each serving a term of May 17, 2023 through December 31, 2024.\nJune meeting - The Council members approved the development and implementation of certain changes to the staking rewards algorithm as presented at the meeting.\n\nHedera Improvement Proposals (HIPs)\n\nHIP-513: Smart Contract Traceability Extension - Enabling mirror nodes to download traceability info only if they need or want to process it. Enabling full replay of smart contract service transactions will improve the usability, auditability, and debuggability of smart contract service transactions.\nHIP-584: Mirror EVM Archive Node - Describes EVM execution APIs on the mirror node and transaction simulations. The HIP also describes initial Mirror Node APIs that will handle contract execution-related queries, thus allowing the Mirror Node to serve the role of an EVM Archive Node.\nHIP-719: Associate and Dissociate Tokens via Facade Contract - HIP-218 proposed a way to enable treating HTS tokens in an equivalent manner to ERC-",

      "title": "State of TRON Q2 2023",
      "content": "Key Insights\n\nTRON’s daily average active accounts, new accounts, and transactions increased by 14%, 13.4%, and 28.9%, respectively. The growth coincided with the launch of the BitTorrent bridge and integrations of Stake 2.0, among other developments.\nThe growth in network activity positively impacted revenue, which increased by 11.6% in TRX QoQ (up 22.2% in USD terms).\nRevenue translated to a substantial amount of TRX burned, which supported the value of TRX during an otherwise flat-to-down market.\nTRX outperformed most L1 tokens in Q2. TRX’s market cap increased 14.7% QoQ, compared to an average decline of 23% for other major L1s.\nEfforts to expand DeFi continued through Q2. Applications and infrastructure providers began integrating TRX liquid staking and the decentralized resource marketplace.\nTRON continued to improve network functionality, including the release of Stake 2.0 (TIP-467), GreatVoyage-V4.7.1.1 (Pittacus) and initiation of Great Voyage-V4.7.2 (Periander).\n\nPrimer on TRON\n\nTRON is a public open-sourced blockchain network using a Delegated-Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) mechanism. DPoS is an election mechanism that determines who maintains the network. An election occurs every six hours, resulting in 27 Super Representatives who take turns producing blocks.\n\nThe TRON Virtual Machine (TVM) powers applications on the network and uses “Energy & Bandwidth” instead of gas, like its Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) counterpart. The TVM is EVM-compatible and offers developers affordable smart contract execution.\n\nWebsite / Twitter / Discord\n\nKey Metrics\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nNetwork Overview\n\nAverage daily active accounts reversed course after a double-digit percentage decline in Q1. Average daily active accounts moved from ~2.3 million to ~2.6 million, representing a 14% increase QoQ.\n\nDaily activated (new) accounts also reversed course and increased by 13.4% QoQ. Daily new account activation reached its highest level in over a year, averaging ~219,000 versus the prior 12-month average of ~180,000.\n\nOn the TRON network, transactions represent all interactions, including token transfers, staking activity, smart contract execution, and voting activity.\n\nAverage daily transactions followed a similar pattern as account activity and grew by 28.9% to ~9.1 million over Q2. The increase can be partially attributed to the transaction type “other transactions,” which include account creation, SR account creation, account permissions update, proposal initiation, and other non-smart contract interactionson the network. “Other transactions” grew by ~1,200% QoQ but comprised only ~8% of all transactions on the network.\n\nTransactions calling smart contracts and TRX transfers were up ~47% and ~10%, respectively. Together, they continued dominating transaction activity on the network, making up 83% of all transactions. Of the smart contracts triggered, the USD Tether (USDT) smart contract remained the primary driver of contract execution on TRON in Q2.\n\nCollectively, incremental growth in network activity was spurred by the spike in activity during June. During June, several developments occurred, including:\n\nBitTorrent Bridge - On June 2, 2023, TRON expanded its reach by connecting with the Ethereum network with the launch of the BitTorrent bridge. The BitTorrent bridge made TRX fully accessible within the Ethereum ecosystem.\nStake 2.0 - On April 7, 2023, Stake 2.0 went live on TRON Mainnet. Stake 2.0 is a new staking model that enhances staking and resource management, streamlines resource allocation, and enables flexible unstaking options. On June 16, 2023, Trust Wallet integrated Stake 2.0, enabling users to stake TRX under the new model.\nDWF Labs - On June 13, 2023, DWF Labs and TRON reached a strategic partnership to strengthen TRON ecosystem support. DWF Labs is a global digital asset market maker and multi-stage Web3 investment firm. It became a liquidity provider for the TRON ecosystem as part of the partnership.\nTUSD - One of TRON’s primary partner exchanges, Huobi, announced 0% fees on maker and taker trades for the TRX/TUSD trading pair at the end of Q1. The offer may have catalyzed the spike in user activity in June and the 72% increase in TUSD value on-chain during Q2.\n\nThe network also saw a significant decrease in transaction fees. During Q2, the average transaction fee in TRX and USD declined by 13.3% and 5.5%, respectively.\n\nThe decline in transaction fees followed a noticeable increase in transaction fees in Q1, which resulted from committee proposal No. 79. The proposal changed network parameters and increased the amount of energy required to execute smart contracts. Further, as part of TIP-474, the dynamic energy model was enabled in Q1 to increase the transaction cost and disincentivize low-value smart contract transactions without affecting other applications. Given the greater activity but lower transaction fees during Q2, low-value smart contract transactions may have been curbed and transaction fees returned to lower levels.\n\nFinancial Overview\n\nDuring Q2, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged that several exchanges engaged in unregistered offers and sales of several cryptoasset securities. This followed the complaint in Q1, which alleged TRX is a security.\n\nThe SEC complaint in June coincided with downward pressure on the value of TRX, but TRX finished the quarter up 14.7%, reaching $6.9 billion. In contrast, the total crypto market cap increased by 2% QoQ, primarily driven by BTC and ETH, which saw a 7% and 6% rise, respectively. Further, most alt-L1 tokens tended to decrease more than ETH due to the SEC’s regulatory complaints.\n\nAs detailed in the <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-tron-q4-2022?referrer=author:james-trautman\">State of TRON Q4 2022</a>, TRON utilizes a resource model. The resource model is based on distributing bandwidth and energy to stakers. As long as stakers have acquired enough resources, they can use those resources to transfer tokens and execute smart contracts for free. Users must cover transaction fees if they utilize more computing power than their resources. Therefore, it follows that total fees paid by users would increase after implementing higher energy requirements (mentioned above) and the dynamic energy model.\n\nThe dynamic energy model and increased requirements for energy implemented in Q1 resulted in more revenue generation in TRX (total transaction fees paid in TRX) that carried on through Q2. Revenue in TRX increased by 11.6% QoQ (+22.2% in USD).\n\nNonetheless, the difference between the change in revenue versus market cap (in USD) suggests that overall fundamental network utility was slightly more significant than market behavior. The circulating market cap of TRX was 17x the annualized quarterly revenue at the end of Q1 2023 versus 16x at the end of Q2, suggesting a slight move to a more favorable valuation.\n\nThe uptrend in revenue continued to translate to a substantial amount of TRX burned, seeing as 100% of transaction fees in TRX are burned. TRON burned ~1.6 billion TRX and generated ~460 million, leading to a deflation rate of ~1.2% during Q2. On May 31, 2023, the TRON DAO burned over 268 million “old” ERC-20 TRX.\n\nUltimately, the resource model parameter changes and the TRON DAO likely improved TRX’s value, supporting the price of TRX during an otherwise flat-to-down market during Q2.\n\nEcosystem and Development Overview\n\nDeFi\n\nTVL denominated in USD was up QoQ, increasing by 7%. However, TVL denominated in TRX decreased by 7.9%, suggesting that asset price increases in USD drove TVL versus new capital inflow.\n\nTRON's most prominent protocols by TVL JustLend, JustStables, SUN, and JustMoney benefited from the renewed network activity and market rebound of TRX throughout Q2. Each increased its TVL QoQ (3%, 14%, 27%, and 63%, respectively), but SocialSwap declined by 83% even after falling by 29% during Q1.\n\nDuring Q2, SUN increased its share of TVL with Blockbank's support for SUN, the launch of SunSwap V2, and the traction of stablecoin swaps and stake-mining on SUN.io. While JustLend’s TVL increased less than other prominent protocols QoQ, there remained some concentration risk in TRON’s leading application. JustLend made up ~68% (~$3.9 billion) of TRON's DeFi TVL by the end of Q2, which continued to be dominated by three addresses.\n\nMoreover, there were other efforts to expand DeFi in Q2. Liquid staking and the decentralized resource marketplace became a reality. Liquid staking enables users to swap their staked TRX for STRX, increasing the liquidity of staked TRX. After tokenizing staked TRX, the resource marketplace allows users to get free resources (Energy and Bandwidth). Finally, it enables applications to implement the resource leasing mechanism through which users can lease energy.\n\nDuring Q2, the initial developments around TRX liquid staking and the resource marketplace included:\n\nHuobi - TRON's primary partner exchange, Huobi, listed STRX.\nJustLend - Announced its support for STRX and enabled users to swap their staked TRX for STRX. JustLend also announced support for the resource marketplace and enabled the leasing mechanism.\nTokenPocket - A multichain crypto and DeFi wallet. It announced its support for the resource leasing mechanism.\n\nOther applications and infrastructure providers will likely implement the liquid staking and resource leasing mechanisms, which could further expand DeFi beyond JustLend.\n\nTRON announced the launch of its first real-world asset (RWA) platform, stUSDT, in Q3. stUSDT is a receipt token that users will receive upon staking USDT. USDT staked in the stUSDT-RWA contract will be allocated to real-world assets. Users will then receive continuous yield from those assets through a rebase mechanism.\n\nStablecoin Landscape\n\nTRON's place in the stablecoin landscape remains substantial. Second to Ethereum, TRON is ahead of other chains in terms of the market cap of hosted stablecoins. At the end of Q2,",

      "content": "Key Insights\n\nBNB Chain’s average daily active addresses and transactions increased by 25.6% and 24.4%, respectively. The growth was primarily driven by a rise in activity from LayerZero.\nBNB Chain’s market cap declined 25.2% after the SEC alleged BNB is a security in its regulatory actions against Coinbase and Binance. In contrast, the total crypto market cap increased by 2% QoQ, primarily driven by BTC and ETH.\nBNB Chain revenue (in BNB) decreased 6.1% QoQ as average transaction fees declined 25.5% after BSC validators voted to reduce gas fees from 5 to 3 Gwei.\nStaking on the network was stable through Q2. BNB Chain plans to increase the number of validators from 29 to 100 with a new validator reward model (balanced mining) and a validator reputation system.\nThe BNB Chain's growth initiatives to invest in the ecosystem were continued by introducing a Gas Grant Program and the Zero2Hero Incubator.\nIncremental network activity resulted in DeFi activity resurgence on LayerZero, NTF platforms, and other use cases, especially in the SocialFi space.\nSeveral technical developments rolled out during Q2, including the Planck hard fork, Luban hard fork, and opBNB.\n\nPrimer on BNB Chain\n\n<a href=\"https://messari.io/article/bnb-chain-the-evolving-juggernaut?referrer=asset:binance-coin\">BNB Chain</a> is a public, open-source blockchain that aims to deliver scalable smart contract support for decentralized applications. It seeks to accomplish this with a modular design and scaling solutions. BNB Chain consists of a multichain framework — the BNB Smart Chain, Beacon Chain, BNB Sidechain, BNB ZkRollup, and most recently, Optimistic Rollup and BNB Greenfield.\n\nThe Beacon Chain is the dedicated layer for governance (staking and voting), and the BNB Smart Chain is the dedicated layer for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) consensus and execution. The BNB Smart Chain is based on a Proof-of-Staked-Authority (PoSA) mechanism and is powered by a growing network of active validators. The BNB Sidechain framework is designed to create BNB Smart Chain-compatible sidechains. Plans also include the launch of ZK-rollups and optimistic rollups for high-performance scaling, allowing sidechains to customize solutions. Finally, BNB Greenfield is designed to serve as a decentralized storage infrastructure within the broader BNB Chain ecosystem.\n\nWebsite / Twitter / Discord\n\nKey Metrics\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nFinancial Overview\n\nDuring Q2, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged that several exchanges (including Binance.US) engaged in unregistered offers and sales of cryptoasset securities, including BNB.\n\nThe SEC complaint in June coincided with downward pressure on the value of BNB, which declined 25.2%. In contrast, the total crypto market cap increased by 2% QoQ, which was primarily driven by BTC and ETH, rising 7% and 6%, respectively. Alt-L1 tokens tended to decrease more than ETH due to the SEC’s regulatory complaints. BNB concluded the quarter as the fourth largest cryptoasset by market capitalization, reaching $37.5 billion.\n\nBeyond the circulating market cap, the circulating supply of BNB continued to decline due to BNB’s token-burning mechanism. By June 30, 2023, over 46 million BNB (~23% of its 200 million total supply) had been burned since the burn program began in 2017. BNB has averaged a deflationary rate of 1.1% over the last year.\n\nRevenue in BNB (total transaction fees paid in BNB) declined by 6.1%, while network value decreased by 25.2% QoQ. The decrease in revenue was largely due to a 25.5% decrease in average transaction fees.\n\nThe difference between the change in revenue versus market cap (in USD) suggests that overall fundamental network utility was more significant than market behavior. The circulating market cap of BNB was 220x the annualized quarterly revenue at the end of Q1 2023 versus 179x at the end of Q2, suggesting a move to a more favorable valuation.\n\nWhile a simple P/S ratio may provide directional insight into fundamental value accrual versus speculative market behavior, it is not necessarily adequate for evaluating blockchain assets. Other valuation techniques have also been introduced, including Messari’s <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/layer-1-value-thesis-the-expected-demand-for-security-model?referrer=all-research\">Expected Demand for Security Model</a> and Multicoin’s Sum of the Parts framework.\n\nNetwork Overview\n\nBNB Chain’s daily average active addresses reached ~1.4 million and increased by 25.6% QoQ. The metric nearly reached the all-time average of ~1.5 million reached at the end of the last bull cycle in Q4 2021. Average new unique addresses increased 91.1% QoQ and reached all-time highs after a spike in activity in late April.\n\nBNB Chain’s daily average transactions also increased by 24.4% QoQ. The increase in BNB Chain address and transaction activity was largely tied to increased activity from LayerZero.\n\nLayerZero is a lightweight, generalized cross-chain messaging protocol. To showcase its use cases, LayerZero Labs developed Stargate, a bridge built on top of LayerZero that avoids using wrapped tokens, increasing user experience, capital efficiency, and removing attack vectors.\n\nAfter LayerZero announced its $120 million Series B fundraising on April 4, activity spiked on many of its supported networks. By June, BNB Chain was hosting 200,000-250,000 LayerZero and Stargate daily transactions and 50,000-60,000 daily unique addresses from those transactions. In addition to Stargate, activity also stemmed from Radiant Capital, an omnichain money market built on LayerZero that deployed on BNB Chain in Q1.\n\nBeyond LayerZero, transaction activity continued to be dominated by PancakeSwap, with the launch of its V3 during Q2. Further, transaction activity was sustained on Hooked Protocol and CyberConnect after experiencing noticeable traction in <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-bnb-chain-q1-2023?referrer=author:james-trautman\">Q1 2023</a>.\n\nWhile daily transactions trended upward, the average daily transaction fee in BNB decreased by 25.5% QoQ. During Q2, BSC validators voted to reduce gas fees by 40%, from 5 to 3 Gwei. The reduction was implemented to remain competitive with other low-cost Ethereum Layer-2 networks.\n\nStaking and Decentralization Overview\n\nTotal stake, average engaged stake (total stake divided by total supply), and the number of validators that validated a block remained relatively unchanged QoQ.\n\nWhile staking and decentralization remained stable through Q2, the network followed two consecutive quarters of expansion after it implemented the following:\n\nBEP-131 - Introduced candidate validators onto BNB Smart Chain to improve the robustness of the network.\nBEP-153 - This release went live in Q4, enabling staking support on the BNB Smart Chain via a new staking system contract.\nBEP-159 - This BEP introduced a permissionless validator election mechanism, bringing the staking economy onto the Beacon Chain.\n\nBEP-131, 153, and 159 should continue to gradually increase staking participation, facilitating a greater distribution of stake.\n\nBNB Chain also plans to further decentralize by introducing a new validator reward model (balanced mining) and a validator reputation system. These steps would increase the number of validators from 29 to 100.\n\nEcosystem and Development Overview\n\nThe drivers of BNB Chain’s network activity and fundamental value accrual include its growth strategy to attract developers and grow its ecosystem.\n\nEcosystem Growth Strategy\n\nBNB Chain has established several growth initiatives that continued through Q2 2023, including:\n\nMVB Accelerator Program - Season six kicked off during Q2 and included 12 teams across DeFi, infrastructure, and consumer applications.\nBNB Builder Grants - Awards dozens of grants each quarter for the creation of public goods.\nGrowth Incentive Program - A $10 million fund to incentivize project growth on BNB Chain.\nKickstart - Provides tools and services to help projects kick start their development. Several projects joined the program in Q2.\nInnovation Hackathon - Prizes and seed investment from BNB Chain and prominent investors.\nBNB Chain Bounty Program - Introduced a new Ecosystem Bounty Board that allows developers, students, and researchers to contribute to the development of BNB Chain and earn rewards.\n\nSimultaneously, the BNB Chain community launched new initiatives to invest in its ecosystem throughout the quarter, including:\n\nGas Grant Program - The program incentivizes projects that contribute to the BNB Chain ecosystem by providing them with gas fee grants proportional to their monthly gas fee volume. The total pool for these gas grants is fixed at $200,000 in BNB tokens each month.\nZero2Hero Incubator - A six week Y Combinator style program was launched and offered technical support and prizes of up to $50,000.\n\nDeFi\n\nFollowing the crypto market relief rally in Q1, TVL denominated in USD was down QoQ, decreasing by 26.3%. However, TVL denominated in BNB was relatively flat (-2.8%).\n\nAlthough excluded from the above TVL figures to avoid double-counting, liquid staking continued to support the DeFi ecosystem. Binance staked ETH launched during Q2 and grew to over $100 million TVL, while TVL on BNB Chain’s most prominent liquid staking derivative (LSD) Ankr declined from $70 million to $50 million (-28%) QoQ.\n\nWeekly DEX volumes reached their highest levels in a year; however, nearly all of the top DeFi applications on BNB Chain experienced declines in TVL. Of these, BNB Chain's most prominent protocols by TVL were PancakeSwap (40%), Venus (13%), Alpaca Finance (20%), and PinkSale (15%). However, with renewed activity on LayerZero, Radiant Capital experienced significant initial traction after its launch on LayerZero in Q1, and its TVL increased by 151% QoQ.\n\nThe continued shift in TVL dominance on BNB Chain signals the formation of a more robust DeFi ecosystem. There is a decreasing risk of the overconcentratio",

      "content": "Key Insights\n\nStacks’ market cap is up 53.3% YTD, fueled by Ordinals and other activity on Bitcoin.\nTVL (USD) set its yearly high of $36.0 million, and TVL (STX) set its all-time high of 56.4 million STX. These milestones are due to multiple factors, including new bridges to Ethereum and BNB, ALEX B20, and sUSDT.\nThe Nakamoto release is still in development, with the aim to reduce block times which would both benefit DeFi UX and help alleviate Bitcoin MEV issues.\nsBTC is still in development, with the aim to grant Stacks access to a massive amount of BTC liquidity via a trust-minimized bridge.\nStacking was disabled for two cycles in reaction to a bug found in the stacking contract. Stacking was reenabled in May prior to Cycle 60.\nWith its added functionality and deep Bitcoin compatibility, Stacks is perfectly positioned to meet the demand for Bitcoin programmability. The demand will not only come from inscriptions but also from future catalysts, such as TradFi interest.\n\nPrimer on Stacks\n\nStacks is a Bitcoin layer for smart contracts. Decentralized applications are executed on Stacks and settled on Bitcoin, leveraging the security and capital of Bitcoin while offering arbitrary programmability that is not possible on Bitcoin’s scriptable settlement layer.\n\nStacks has knowledge of the full Bitcoin state, thanks to its Proof-of-Transfer (PoX) consensus mechanism and Clarity programming language, enabling it to read from Bitcoin at any time. With PoX, miners commit BTC to eligible Stacks addresses that participate in consensus. This process of STX holders participating in consensus and earning BTC from miners is known as Stacking and was launched as part of the Stacks Mainnet launch in January 2021. PoX runs parallel to Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) consensus, hashing and settling Stacks transactions on the Bitcoin L1. Metadata from newly mined Stacks blocks are anchored to every Bitcoin block, allowing users to verify the canonical Stacks chain via Bitcoin blocks.\n\nWebsite / Twitter / Telegram / Discord\n\nKey Metrics\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nNetwork Overview\n\nAverage daily transactions declined 22.7% QoQ, from 9,200 to 7,100. Average daily active addresses (DAA) declined more severely, down 44.8% QoQ from 3,100 to 1,700. While daily transactions and DAA were down QoQ, they were still up 47.1% and 24.0% from their bottoms in Q3’22, respectively. In general, Stacks’ activity metrics calmed down in Q2 after the Bitcoin Name Service (BNS) activity and the Bitcoin Inscriptions craze that fueled activity metrics in Q4’22 and Q1’23.\n\nDespite activity metrics cooling down, plenty of infrastructure continued to be built to capture and amplify the next wave of activity to come in from Bitcoin Layer-1 (L1) programmability (more details in the Qualitative section of the report).\n\nThis relative persistence of daily transactions implies that the users that did remain active in Q2 were high-frequency users, executing more transactions on average than the users that were not active in Q2.\n\nThese statistics could also have been skewed by bots (Note: bots are not exclusive to Stacks and occur at some level on all chains) that executed a disproportionately high amount of transactions and remained active while many users were inactive.\n\nUnlike previous quarters, overall activity trends were not shaped by BNS activity. Instead, the activity sources were diversified among alternative NFT collections like Metaboy and DeFi applications like ALEX. While average daily transactions did decrease 22.7% QoQ, they held up relatively well, considering the previous activity catalyst, BNS, was nearly inactive.\n\nFinancial Overview\n\nSTX is the native token on Stacks and is used primarily for transaction fees and miner rewards. STX’s circulating market cap decreased 25.8% QoQ from $1.29 billion to $955 million, lagging behind the total crypto market cap’s increase of 0.4%. However, STX’s market cap is still up 53.3% YTD, as this Q2 pullback did not erase the massive price gain seen in Q1’23.\n\nRevenue is measured as total transaction fees and is distributed to Miners through Stack’s PoX mechanism. Q1’s quarterly revenue of $65,000 was primarily due to a couple of extreme days in late March near STX’s price peak. Q2’s revenue of $42,000, while down 35.5% QoQ, is still up 105.5% YTD. The introduction of more assets into Stacks’ growing ecosystem will create more urgency around transactions, which in turn should increase network revenue as users seek to outbid each other. Small spikes can be attributed to events such as NFT mints and times of high volatility when many users are trying to make exchanges.\n\nStacks is tightly coupled with Bitcoin not only in technical architecture but also in activity and price action. Through the first half of 2023, STX price increased 73.7% relative to BTC.\n\nEcosystem Overview\n\nMuch like various network and financial metrics, ecosystem metrics also had a pullback after a massive Q1. However, TVL (USD) was relatively resilient, only decreasing by 7.5%. TVL (USD) finished the quarter up 247.9% YTD. This relative stability in TVL brought the market cap / TVL ratio down from 48.3 to 38.7. The movement could be a good sign as a smaller market cap / TVL ratio indicates a larger ecosystem relative to the token’s size.\n\nDaily contract calls and NFT activity declined in Q2. Contract activity remained slightly positive YTD, but NFT transactions and NFT trading volume decreased 66.3% and 52.0%, respectively, bringing them to yearly lows.\n\nALEX\n\nALEX is a multi-headed DeFi protocol, focused on trading and lending/borrowing cryptoassets with Bitcoin as the settlement layer. The automated market-making (AMM) protocol is at the core of ALEX’s ecosystem, providing liquidity for its Launchpad and Orderbook. ALEX’s average daily DEX volume increased 47% QoQ and 564% YTD. Trading pairs involving ALEX’s tokens and STX accounted for the majority of the volume. Volumes surged in mid-May following the launch of ALEX B20.\n\nALEX continued to gain TVL dominance for the second consecutive quarter. ALEX has firmly established itself as the heart of Stacks DeFi, with 92.1% TVL dominance as of Q2. The immediate focus for ALEX is to build the most user-friendly, scalable BRC-20 trading DEX. Other services include Trading Pool, Lend/Borrow, and Launchpad, with more to come in its new roadmap.\n\nOn May 16, TVL (USD) set its yearly high of $36.0 million, and TVL (STX) set its all-time high of 56.4 million STX. These milestones are due to multiple factors, including\n\nThe launch of ALEX B20, the first-ever decentralized order book for BRC-20s. BRC-20 is a fungible token standard on Bitcoin created by Domo, who is now on ALEX’s advisory board.\nThe Launchpad, a platform made to facilitate the launch of BRC-20s, had its first release in Ordmint.\nThe Stacks Ethereum and Stacks BNB bridges launched.\nThe launch of sUSDT, bridged USDT.\n\nNFTs\n\nBNS, the Bitcoin Name System, remains the most popular NFT on Stacks. Gamma, both a marketplace on Stacks and an Ordinals marketplace on Bitcoin, is the most dominant NFT marketplace on Stacks.\n\nIn early May, contributing factors to the spike in NFT sales volume include sales of gaming project MetaBoy and a single 7,500 STX sale of a Megapont Ape. Megapont Ape Club is the largest PFP collection on Stacks, with over 5 million STX in lifetime volume and over 1,000 holders. However, the largest overall NFT collection on Stacks is BNS, with over 1.4 million STX in lifetime volume and over 300,000 holders.\n\nBNS allows users to interact with wallets via human-readable domain names, similar to other domain services such as <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-ens-q4-2022\">ENS</a> and ADA Handle. There are eight different types of BNS contract calls, but 99.9% of BNS transactions come from only four types: name-update, name-transfer, name-register, and name-preorder.\n\nDespite an 89.7% QoQ decline in BNS registrations, the total number of BNS names crossed 300,000 in Q2. The only BNS transaction type to increase in activity QoQ was name-update. This metric will likely increase in activity over time regardless of overall BNS activity, as the number of names that can be updated will continually increase.\n\nStaking Overview\n\nStacking rewards were impacted by a bug in the stacks-increase function. The community and developers reached a consensus on resetting the Proof of Transfer (PoX) state and implementing a fork to revert the network to proof-of-burn temporarily. PoX Stacking was disabled for cycles 58 and 59, approximately one-third of Q2. The <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/f3756ad0-c9ee-4445-a4ed-3f8677d2e578\">Stacks 2.4</a> hardfork re-enabled Stacking on May 26 prior to Cycle 60, ~5 weeks after the bug was identified.\n\nQualitative Analysis\n\nCommunity\n\nBitcoin Miami 2023 took place, with builders and community members gathering.\nThe first-ever Bitcoin Builders Conference took place in Miami, following Bitcoin Miami. The lectures and workshops at this event focused primarily on Bitcoin layers.\nThe Bitcoin Frontier Fund, formerly Stacks Ventures, hosted its Demo Day in June to showcase its third cohort of startups. Startups from previous cohorts include ALEX, Gamma, Xverse, and over 50 other projects.\nReady Layer 2, a Bitcoin Layer-2-focused pitch competition, was announced in Q2 and will be taking place on July 28. Ready Layer 2 is a three-day-long virtual event focused on education, mentoring, and pitching ideas for prizes. Representatives from sBTC, Bitcoin Frontier Fund, Stacks Foundation, Zest Protocol, and more will be judging and mentoring the winners.\nBitcoin Startup Lab, a Bitcoin startup accelerator, concluded on June 20. The projects it supported were focused on all areas of the Bitcoin ecosystem, including Stacks, such as the gaming toolkit Force Prime.\nThe Bitcoin Olympics Hackathon took place in April.\nThe Stacks Grants Program is piloting a decentralized grants program. The program aims to implement a votin",

      "content": "Key Insights\n\nTezos is making significant progress in its rollup infrastructure roadmap, with the introduction of WASM rollups and an EVM-compatible rollup on testnet. Multiple teams have committed to building rollups, and core developers announced a strategic shift to hybrid optimistic/zk rollups.\nThe 14th network upgrade, Nairobi, is now live, offering notable improvements such as increased TPS, new rollup functionality, and enhanced attestations.\nTezos core developers unveiled the Data Availability Layer (DAL), which will operate in parallel with Tezos Layer-1. Leveraging Tezos validators, the DAL ensures data availability while scaling bandwidth and storage capacity.\nDeFi is experiencing growing traction on Tezos, with the TVL nearly doubling in the past year. Several new DeFi protocols are nearing launch including novel DEXs, lending protocols, and perps protocols.\nTezos introduced the Tezos Ecosystem DAO, aimed at managing and distributing XTZ to support community initiatives. This DAO fosters community participation and contributes to the growth of the Tezos ecosystem.\n\nPrimer on Tezos\n\nTezos is a Liquid Proof-of-Stake (LPoS) blockchain network that relies on low power consumption and energy-efficient consensus. It combines on-chain governance with self-amending functionality to implement forkless network upgrades and manage future changes. Tezos supports multiple smart contract languages, has a robust NFT ecosystem, and continues to scale through EVM and WASM compatible rollups and data availability layer improvements.\n\nWebsite / Twitter / Discord\n\nKey Metrics\n\nFinancial Overview\n\nMarket Capitalization and Revenue\n\nTezos experienced a strong <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-tezos-q1-2023?referrer=asset:tezos\">Q1 2023</a>, with market capitalization surging from $0.66 billion to $1.03 billion (+55%), outperforming the broader market by 9%. However, in Q2, Tezos retraced some of the gains from Q1, witnessing a 30% QoQ drop and ending the quarter with a market capitalization of $0.72 billion. The majority of the decline followed the SEC’s complaints against <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/e1fbfd61-f6af-412d-a1c4-9deea7a883bd\">Binance</a> and <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/79ad00d4-9b49-40b0-b3e2-6173bd08863d\">Coinbase</a>.\n\nIn contrast, the total crypto market capitalization during Q2 increased by 2%. The increase was primarily driven by BTC and Ethereum, which saw a 7% and 6% rise, respectively, propelled by the introduction of <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/weekly-recap-blackrock-btc-etf-ordinals-2-0-uniswap-v4-and-more?referrer=asset:bitcoin\">Bitcoin Spot ETFs</a>.\n\nTezos' revenue, measured by total gas fees spent (excluding storage costs), experienced a decrease of 82% QoQ in Q2. This decline was primarily influenced by a 79% decrease in the average transaction fee. The reduction in the average transaction fee was attributed to the decline of the XTZ price and a slowdown in NFT front-running bidding activities.\n\nXTZ Token\n\nTezos` native token (XTZ) serves various functions within the network, including being a medium of exchange, payment for gas fees, staking, delegation, validator rewards, and governance.\n\nXTZ has a fixed annual inflation rate of 42 million XTZ (4.4% with a total supply of 965 million XTZ). Before the Mumbai upgrade, Tezos had 30-second block times and rewarded 40 XTZ per block. However, the upgrade reduced block times to 15 seconds and halved block rewards to maintain the annual inflation rate. Over time, the inflation rate becomes a smaller percentage of the circulating supply.\n\nTezos has implemented burn mechanisms through actions like creating new accounts or smart contracts, allocating additional smart contract storage, and imposing penalties on misbehaving validators. The burn rate remains minimal, with less than 1% of tokens burned annually. As of the end of Q2, there were 965 million XTZ in circulation, with the total supply fully vested.\n\nStakers on Tezos currently earn an annual staking yield of 6.4%, translating to a real yield of 1.7%.\n\nNetwork Overview\n\nUsage\n\nTezos account-related metrics showed moderation in Q2 2023, following strong performance in <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-tezos-q4-2022?referrer=asset:tezos\">Q4 2022</a> and <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-tezos-q1-2023?referrer=asset:tezos\">Q1 2023</a>. The total number of active accounts decreased by 20% QoQ, from 307,000 to 247,000. Similarly, the total number of new accounts decreased by 16% QoQ, from 72,000 to 61,000. However, these figures remain consistent with the averages over the past year.\n\nUsage on the Tezos crypto network is measured through the analysis of smart contract calls and transactions. Smart contract calls represent user-initiated requests to interact with smart contracts, while transactions involve the transfer of tokens.\n\nDuring Q2, Tezos displayed consistent usage levels when compared to previous quarters. Tezos recorded an average of 53,000 daily smart contract calls, representing a 7% decrease from the previous quarter. Additionally, there was an average of 41,000 daily transactions, indicating a 1% decline QoQ. NFTs remain the key driver of activity on Tezos, while DeFi applications continue to see greater adoption.\n\nThe Mumbai upgrade, launched in March, marked a significant milestone for Tezos. This upgrade introduced Smart Contract Optimistic Rollups (SCORUs), which enhance the network's capabilities. SCORUs enable increased throughput, support for new execution environments, and improve scalability, security, and functionality. These advancements are expected to foster greater activity on the Tezos network.\n\nDevelopment\n\nThe Mumbai upgrade also has significant implications for Tezos' development. It introduces a new method of developing decentralized applications on Tezos using any language that compiles to WASM, including Rust, C/C++, Go, and Python. Additionally, Tezos has plans to further support the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) in the future. With the launch of Mumbai and its supporting developer applications and Smart Contract Optimistic Rollup functionality, the Tezos ecosystem is expected to attract more developers.\n\nTezos new contract deployments were flat in Q2. Additionally, Tezos was ranked thirteenth in developer activity through the first half of 2023 according to Electric Capital, boasting 111 full-time developers and 294 total developers.\n\nProtocol Upgrades\n\nMumbai Upgrade\n\nThe Mumbai upgrade on March 29 was highly anticipated. The upgrade included:\n\nSmart Rollups live on Mainnet: With Smart Rollups, anyone can deploy decentralized WebAssembly applications with dedicated computational and networking resources.\nBlock time reduced to 15 seconds: With improved pipelining validation fully deployed, block propagation times are significantly reduced, allowing for minimal block time to be halved to 15 seconds.\nTicket transfers between user accounts: With Mumbai, Tezos tickets can be transferred between user accounts (i.e., implicit accounts) and not just to/from smart contracts and rollups.\nRPCs for ticket balances: Two new RPC endpoints were added to improve the visibility of ticket ownership.\nNew Michelson operations: Michelson opcodes were extended to support logical operations on bytes, and an opcode was added to convert between bytes and nat values.\nA peek at validity rollups: Validity rollups (ZK-rollups), arrived on the testnet.\n\nSmart Rollups play a crucial role in Tezos' scaling plan and are essential to achieving the target of 1 million transactions per second. However, Smart Rollups offer more than just scaling. They provide a new method of developing decentralized applications on Tezos, using any language that compiles to WASM, including Rust, C/C++, Go, and Python.\n\nNairobi Upgrade\n\nThe Nairobi upgrade, activated on Tezos mainnet on June 23, 2023, introduces several notable features:\n\nAn up to 8x increase in TPS for transactions, smart contract calls, Smart Rollup maintenance operations, and other manager operations, thanks to an improved gas model for cryptographic signatures.\nNew functionality for Smart Rollups, including new host functions and new internal Layer 2 messages allowing rollup kernels to sync with Tezos protocol upgrades.\nRenaming endorsements to attestations.\nFaster propagation of pre-attestations to reach consensus earlier.\n\nData Availability Layer\n\nThe introduction of Smart Rollups in the Mumbai upgrade marked a significant advancement in Tezos' scalability potential. As Tezos continues to pursue its goal of achieving millions of transactions per second, the development of a robust data availability solution becomes crucial. To address this challenge, Tezos core developers are working on a protocol-level solution called the Data Availability Layer (DAL).\n\nThe DAL will run in parallel with the Tezos Layer-1 as an independent peer-to-peer network. It will leverage Tezos bakers and guarantee data availability while significantly scaling bandwidth and storage capacity. The DAL is currently in development, with an early version available on the Mondaynet testnet, and is expected to be activated through a protocol upgrade in early 2024.\n\nRollups\n\nTezos has been making significant advancements in its rollup infrastructure roadmap. The network has successfully implemented WASM rollups, and teams such as Baking Bad and Plenty are actively involved in rollup development.\n\nIn addition to WASM rollups, Tezos has introduced an EVM-compatible Smart Rollup on the Ghostnet testnet. This rollup enables the deployment and execution of Ethereum smart contracts on the Tezos network. The rollup can be accessed through the Octez software suite and is currently in the alpha stage of development.\n\nLooking ahead, Tezos has announced a strategic shift in its rollup roadmap. Instead of pursuing separate optimistic and validity rollup solutions, the network aims to combine these approaches into a hybrid model. T",

      "content": "Key Insights\n\nReduced emissions and a subdued market continue to weigh on volumes and users, each down over 25% in Q2.\nThe bright spot in the second quarter was IBC transfers, which yielded nearly half a billion dollars in inflows to Osmosis.\nGovernance and development remained active, highlighted by the unveiling of OSMO 2.0. The revised tokenomics for the network will reduce inflation and extend the emissions timeline, while also introducing burn and fee switch mechanisms.\n\nPrimer on Osmosis\n\nOsmosis is a sovereign decentralized exchange (DEX)-focused app-chain in the Cosmos ecosystem, meaning it simultaneously serves as a blockchain and an application. The application operates similarly to other automated market making (AMM) functioning DEXs – liquidity providers (LPs), which are responsible for supplying liquidity to asset pools where traders can make trades from. It’s the same model for Uniswap or Balancer, though more similar to the latter as Osmosis places a high priority on offering asset pool customization. Tweaks to market-maker functions, swap costs, token weighting, and more are all parameters that can be changed within the DEX. Additionally, Osmosis has introduced new features such as superfluid staking that allows users who provided liquidity in certain pools to also stake to help secure the network. In the future, Osmosis will also offer maximal extractable value (MEV) mitigation and capture, stable pools, and more.\n\n  \n\nKey Metrics\n\nProtocol Usage\n\nDEX Metrics\n\nAfter an increase in volume in Q1, partially brought on by the spike around the USDC depeg, second quarter volumes fell 43% QoQ. The makeup of volumes has been changing, with ATOM volumes falling to 15% of total volume in Q2, its lowest share since ever. USDC made up 14.9% of volume in Q2, its lowest in the last four quarters, which will likely change when native USDC is introduced to the Cosmos network.\n\nDespite the increase in the end-of-period liquidity provided on Osmosis Q1, the average daily liquidity has been trending lower since Q1’22. The trend accelerated in Q2’23, with average daily liquidity falling 17.9% from the previous quarter. Depositors remained patient in Q2, as average daily yield from trading fees fell to 3.8% (daily fees per unit of TVL, compounding daily) from 5.6% in Q1. Liquidity providers also earn fees from incentives, which are not included in this yield calculation.\n\n  \n  \n\nNetwork Metrics\n\nTransaction counts of every type fell in Q2 but by very different margins. After a busy Q1, governance-related activity saw the largest QoQ decline. Voting and Osmosis staking transactions were down 71% and 55%, respectively, accounting for nearly a third of the fall in transactions counts in the quarter. The smallest percentage decreases were in transactions related to the core product, with IBC transfers and swaps falling only 21% and 23%, respectively.\n\nAfter nearly a year of subdued value flows, over $466 million was transferred to Osmosis via the IBC network. Total IBC transfer volume on Osmosis actually fell 4% from the previous quarter to $2.1 billion transferred. April and May were the largest net transfer months for the protocol since the LUNA collapse in May 2022.\n\n  \n\nNotable Events\n\nOsmosis Proposals\n\n<a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/58691b39-c4a0-47ef-afa0-5ffbbe322ac1\">April 17, 2023</a>, Lengthen OSMO Emission Schedule — Osmosis Proposal 484 aimed to lengthen the OSMO emission schedule to maintain a maximum supply close to the original tokenomic design.

We also include <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-ethereum-q2-2023?utmmedium=referral&utmsource=report&utmcampaign=stateofl1sq22023\">Ethereum</a> as a benchmark.\n\nKey Insights\n\nDriven by protocol (Shapella upgrade), ecosystem (meme coins), and regulatory (SEC complaints, ETF filings) catalysts, ETH outperformed alt-L1 tokens in Q2’23. ETH’s market cap increased 3% QoQ, compared to an average decline of 23% for other featured L1s.\nLiquid staking protocols and the downstream use of their liquid staking tokens (LSTs) in DeFi have gained significant attention in 2023. LSTs are replacing native tokens as the prime form of DeFi collateral, as well as leading to innovation in restaking protocols, LST-backed stablecoins, interest-rate derivatives, and more.\nCardano led featured L1s in QoQ growth rates of DeFi TVL, DEX volume, and stablecoin market cap. Of the three metrics, Cardano’s stablecoin market cap has the furthest to still go to catch up to other networks, having ended the quarter at $14 million.\nAvalanche C-Chain outpaced featured L1s in QoQ growth rates of transactions, active addresses, new addresses, and total transaction fees. The surge in network activity was primarily driven by usage of the cross-chain messaging protocol LayerZero.\n\nKey Trends\n\nETH Outperforms Alt-L1 Tokens\n\nThe crypto market in Q2’23 can be broken down into four waves driven by:\n\nEthereum’s Shapella upgrade\nMeme coin mania\nSEC complaints against Binance and Coinbase\nBTC ETF filings by BlackRock and other firms\n\nEach wave was a relative positive for Ethereum, which ended the quarter with a 3% increase in market cap compared to an average 23% decline for other featured L1s.\n\nOn April 12, the milestone <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/01d82721-34f9-44f2-942f-9fe77879d084\">Shapella upgrade</a> marked Ethereum's successful transition to Proof-of-Stake and de-risked staking by enabling withdrawals. Despite concerns about the potential sell pressure from withdrawn stake, ETH experienced a 10% rally in the days following the upgrade. This bullish price action had a positive spillover effect on alt-L1 networks, albeit to a lesser extent.\n\nThe second half of April into early May featured a meme coin craze led by <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/pepe-by-the-numbers?referrer=all-research\">PEPE</a>. Despite the high gas fees, most of the activity remained on Ethereum, as it features the most liquidity (and whales). When PEPE reached its peak price on May 5, ETH spiked around 5%. After PEPE’s top, all L1 tokens sold off as the speculative activity waned.\n\nAfter a period of relative calm, the SEC’s regulatory complaints against <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/e1fbfd61-f6af-412d-a1c4-9deea7a883bd\">Binance</a> and <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/79ad00d4-9b49-40b0-b3e2-6173bd08863d\">Coinbase</a> negatively shocked the market in early June. The native tokens of five of the featured L1s were alleged to be securities in the complaints: ADA, BNB, MATIC, NEAR, and SOL. From June 5 to June 15, these five tokens witnessed an average decline of 29%, while ETH decreased by 13% and other featured L1s dropped by 21% on average. Robinhood’s subsequent announcement to delist ADA, MATIC, and SOL by June 27 exacerbated the downward pressure. Notably, after the initial drop, SOL rallied stronger than the other four tokens named as securities, finishing the quarter only down 9%.\n\nOn June 15, BlackRock <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/73dd45ca-764f-4c2a-a189-b832401a9e46\">filed</a> for a spot BTC ETF, prompting many other firms to follow suit. Once again, ETH performed the strongest after this news, given that ETH is the next most likely candidate for a spot ETF. Although SEC Chair Gensler refused to clarify ETH’s security status during April hearings, its exclusion from the recent SEC complaints and the recently released Hinman emails suggest that Ethereum enjoys a relatively secure regulatory standing.\n\nZooming out, BTC dominance reached 50% at the end of the quarter, a level not seen since April 2021. Historically, BTC dominance precedes market rallies.\n\nUpdate: The recent <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/d0b03f10-ed7c-40de-830e-24aa997d3e08\">XRP ruling</a> was a regulatory win for crypto, although it’s not a closed case. Following the news, alt-L1 tokens generally outperformed ETH, especially the ones previously alleged as securities. BTC dominance has dipped from its high of over 52% near the end of Q2’23 back to around 50% following the ruling. For more on XRP and the ruling, see Red’s “<a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-xrp-ledger-q2-2023?utmmedium=referral&utmsource=report&utmcampaign=stateofl1sq22023\">State of XRP Ledger Q2 2023</a>” and the Enterprise team’s <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/weekly-recap-ripple-coinbase-wallet-and-more?utmmedium=referral&utmsource=report&utmcampaign=stateofl1sq22023\">weekly recap</a>.\n\nLiquid Staking and LSTfi\n\nLiquid staking protocols and the downstream use of their liquid staking tokens (LSTs) in DeFi have gained significant attention in 2023, particularly within the Ethereum ecosystem. By the end of the quarter, over half of ETH stake was in liquid form, including Coinbase’s cbETH, a 25% year-to-date (YTD) increase. This surge coincided with a rise in ETH staking, driven by the Shapella upgrade, which reduced the risk of staking by enabling withdrawals.\n\nOn Ethereum, liquid staking generally offers two advantages:\n\nIt allows tokenholders to stake without running their own validator, which requires 32 ETH and technical expertise. The other popular workaround is staking through centralized exchanges. Comparatively, liquid staking protocols typically charge lower fees, are community-governed, and are generally more committed to increasing validator decentralization.\nIt allows stakeholders to maintain liquidity, creating more opportunities in DeFi.\n\nIn contrast, most other L1s employ a mechanism that allows tokenholders to delegate tokens to a validator and earn a share of rewards. As a result, the first advantage is not applicable to these blockchains. Therefore, users typically choose to liquid stake on these networks in order to unlock liquidity to participate in DeFi. Given the less developed nature of alt-L1 DeFi ecosystems, many tokenholders are willing to stake their tokens in illiquid form. Doing so avoids additional smart contract risk (both from liquid staking and DeFi protocols), slightly lower rewards, and potentially different tax implications.\n\nTo determine how tokenholders perceive this tradeoff, we measured the percent of tokens that are not staked in illiquid form. We categorized these tokens as “free-flowing,” i.e., any token that is either liquid staked or not staked in system contracts.\n\nEthereum led with 91.5% of free-flowing supply, but as mentioned above, there are compelling reasons to liquid stake ETH besides using LSTs in DeFi. Although BNB Chain has a low liquid stake rate, it also has a low overall stake rate, leaving it with around 85% of free-flowing supply. BNB’s high figure is likely driven by the token’s various use cases on the Binance exchange. Comparatively, Solana, Avalanche, and NEAR have high stake rates and low liquid stake rates, leaving 31%, 40%, and 55% of supply free-flowing, respectively. For these networks and others like it, LSTfi offers an opportunity to increase participation in DeFi, leading to a more robust ecosystem.\n\nFor the first time ever, LSTs enable DeFi applications to leverage predictable, low-risk, and crypto-native real yield. The rapid innovation from existing and new protocols targeting this emerging opportunity has spawned a distinct category of DeFi known as LST finance (LSTfi). At its most basic, LSTfi entails the replacement of native tokens with LSTs as collateral across DeFi. On the leading lending protocols of Ethereum (Aave), Avalanche (Aave), Solana (Solend), and NEAR (Burrow), the amount of LSTs deposited has surpassed that of native tokens, and this trend continues to expand.\n\nBeyond replacing native tokens as collateral in lending protocols, innovation in LSTfi has included restaking protocols, LST-backed stablecoins, yield optimizers, interest-rate derivates, and more.\n\nFor more on liquid staking and LSTfi, see Kunal’s report “<a href=\"https://messari.io/report/ethereum-s-ecosystem-is-staking-up?utmmedium=referral&utmsource=report&utmcampaign=stateofl1sq22023\">Ethereum’s Ecosystem is Staking Up</a>.”\n\nCardano’s DeFi Growth Rate Continues to Lead Pack\n\nCardano has now been in the top two of featured L1s for QoQ growth of DeFi TVL, Stablecoin Market Cap, and DEX volume in back-to-back quarters. This quarter, Cardano swept all three categories and also finished second in DeFi Diversity growth. While growth rates slowed this quarter, market conditions were much less favorable, with ADA",

      "content": "Key Insights\n\nAvalanche’s average daily active addresses and transactions on the C-Chain increased by 132.1% and 162.2%, respectively. The growth was primarily driven by a rise in stablecoin liquidity and activity from LayerZero.\nRenewed network activity positively impacted revenue, which increased by 173.1% in AVAX QoQ (up 150.3% in USD terms).\nAva Labs introduced Avalanche Arcad3 to accelerate gaming development with partners like GREE, Loco, and TSM.\nEvergreen Subnets and Spruce were launched during Q2. Spruce ushered in several partners, including T. Rowe Price, WisdomTree, Wellington Management, and Cumberland.\nAlibaba Cloud launched Cloudverse, a launchpad for businesses to deploy metaverses on Avalanche.\nSK, one of South Korea’s largest conglomerates, launched its dedicated Avalanche Subnet, UPTN.\nThe Cortina network upgrade was activated on the Avalanche mainnet and introduced three key optimizations.\n\nPrimer on Avalanche\n\nThe Avalanche network is a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) smart contract platform for decentralized applications. Avalanche differentiates itself by creating and implementing a consensus family known as \"Avalanche consensus.\"\n\nFollowing years of research, the Avalanche mainnet was launched in September 2020 and featured the release of a multichain framework utilizing three chains: the P, X, and C chains. Each chain plays a critical and unique role within the Avalanche ecosystem while providing the same capabilities of a single network, often called the Primary Network. Avalanche consensus and the Primary Network are designed to support sovereign, interconnected blockchains known as subnets.\n\nSubnets are subclasses of Primary Network validators that run the same Virtual Machines (VMs) with their own rules. Subnets enable different properties of reliability, efficiency, and data sovereignty. They provide the ability to create custom blockchains for different use cases while isolating high-traffic applications from congesting activity on the Primary Network.\n\nWebsite / Twitter / Discord\n\nKey Metrics\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nNetwork Overview\n\nThe metrics of the Avalanche network are based on the Primary Network (which includes P, X, and C-Chains) and 15 Avalanche Subnets including:\n\nDFK\nDEXALOT\nSTEPNETWORK\nNUMBERS\nXPLUS\nSHRAPNEL\nWRAPTAG\nLOCO LEGENDS\nPLAY3ULL GAMES\nHUBBLE EXCHANGE\nMELD\nUPTN\nSWIMMER\nDOS\nXANACHAIN\n\nTo join the Avalanche architecture, every subnet must provide at least one validator to the Primary Network (staking 2,000 AVAX). For its own consensus, each subnet utilizes anywhere from three to all P-Chain validators. Therefore, every subnet is considered when evaluating overall network activity in terms of transactions and users.\n\nAvalanche’s daily average active addresses across the C-Chain and subnets increased by 107.8% and reached all-time highs QoQ. The QoQ increase was dominated by address activity on the C-Chain, up 132.1% QoQ versus a 22.6% increase across the other 15 subnets.\n\nAvalanche’s daily average transactions also increased QoQ. Transactions on the C-Chain increased by 162.2%, largely due to a rise in stablecoin liquidity and LayerZero. However, transactions across subnets declined by 33.4%. This decline was primarily due to a 31.7% decrease in transactions on the DFK (DeFi Kingdoms) subnet.\n\nLayerZero is a lightweight, generalized cross-chain messaging protocol. To showcase its use cases, LayerZero Labs launched support for BTC.b in Q4 (which has grown significantly on Avalanche). The team also developed Stargate, a bridge built on top of LayerZero. It avoids using wrapped tokens and removes attack vectors, while also increasing user experience and capital efficiency.\n\nCounting Avalanche transactions with LayerZero or Stargate contracts in the event logs, the cross-chain protocols accounted for 45-60% of Avalanche’s growth in each of the following four metrics: average daily transactions (162%), active addresses (142%), new addresses (235%), and transaction fees (166%).\n\nFinancial Overview\n\nDespite the renewed activity seen through Q2, AVAX’s financial performance suffered in June given the challenging regulatory climate. On June 5, 2023, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleged that several exchanges unlawfully engaged in unregistered offers and sales of cryptoasset securities.\n\nThe SEC complaint coincided with downward pressure on AVAX’s price, which declined 22.2% versus the broader market’s 1.3% increase QoQ. Avalanche concluded the quarter as the 18th largest cryptoasset by market capitalization reaching $4.5 billion.\n\nThe renewed activity, however, positively impacted revenue in AVAX (total transaction fees paid in AVAX). Revenue in AVAX increased by 173.1% QoQ (up 150.3% in USD terms). The increase in revenue was partly due to a 5.9% increase in transaction fees, but it was primarily due to the activity stemming from LayerZero. Additionally, the spike in revenue in late April was driven by XEN Crypto, a free-to-mint token known for clogging networks. Given that Avalanche burns 100% of revenue (gas fees), the greater activity contributed to the burn of AVAX and token value accrual.\n\nNonetheless, the difference between the change in revenue versus market cap (in USD) suggests that the overall fundamental network utility was more significant than market behavior in Q2. The circulating market cap of AVAX was 795x the annualized quarterly revenue at the end of Q1 2023 versus 247x at the end of Q2, suggesting a move to a more favorable valuation.\n\nWhile a simple P/S ratio may provide directional insight into fundamental value accrual versus speculative market behavior, it is not necessarily adequate for evaluating blockchain assets. Other valuation techniques, including the <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/layer-1-value-thesis-the-expected-demand-for-security-model?referrer=all-research\">Expected Demand for Security Model</a> (EDSM), have also been introduced to gain a better picture.\n\nDemand for security has largely become a value accrual mechanism for AVAX. When the hundreds of subnets under development go live, value will also accrue to the network according to the EDSM. As each subnet contributes to its security (expanding infrastructure), it will simultaneously demand security for its sovereign subnets. While all the current subnets use their own token for gas, some upcoming subnets will use AVAX as their native token. Nonetheless, as the addition of thousands of subnets increases demand for security (a larger validator set), demand for AVAX will also increase.\n\nEcosystem and Development Overview\n\nDeFi\n\nFollowing the crypto market relief rally in Q1, TVL denominated in USD was down QoQ, decreasing by 19.4%. However, TVL denominated in AVAX increased by 9.7%, suggesting that new capital inflow drove TVL versus asset price increases in USD.\n\nAlthough excluded from the above TVL figures to avoid double-counting, liquid staking derivatives (LSDs) continued to support Avalanche and its DeFi ecosystem. After launching its Ignite protocol and growing TVL by 88.6% in Q1, Benqi liquid staking cooled down, and its TVL declined by 13.3% QoQ to ~$88 million.\n\nNearly all of the top DeFi applications on Avalanche experienced declines in TVL. Of these, Avalanche’s most prominent protocols by TVL denominated in USD were Aave (20%), Benqi Lending (10%), Trader Joe (33%), and GMX (22%). However, with renewed activity on LayerZero and Stargate, TVL on Stargate increased by 21% and contributed to the new capital inflow denominated in AVAX.\n\nEven though Aave TVL was down QoQ, it still carried some concentration risk for Avalanche. By the end of Q2, Aave made up ~43% (~$345 million) of Avalanche's DeFi TVL.\n\nThat said, Avalanche made several moves to expand its DeFi ecosystem beyond Aave, including:\n\nArrow Markets — An options AMM and decentralized settlement system. It introduced Arrow V2 and launched Call Spread Option Vaults (CSOVs) in the first deployment of its Generalized Options Vaults (GOVs) infrastructure on the C-Chain.\nCables Finance — A hybrid DEX with non-custodial access to centralized liquidity. The DEX went live on the C-Chain during Q2.\nCircle — Launched Euro Coin (EUROC) natively on Avalanche. EUROC was subsequently integrated with Trader Joe, Cables Finance, and Glacier Exchange.\nMELD — DeFi infrastructure that launched its subnet during Q2.\nVoltz — Announced its TradFi rate trading venue with the launch of a Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) rates market.\nStruct Finance — A structured finance protocol went live with its first vault during Q2. The application subsequently received a strategic allocation of Avalanche Rush incentives from GMX.\nHubble Exchange — A purpose-built central limit order book subnet launched its testnet in Q2.\nAltitude — An asset bridge subnet powered by LayerZero launched its testnet during Q2 and experienced initial traction.\nUnchained Music — A music platform announced deploying artist royalty capital to various vetted DeFi protocols on the C-Chain.\n\nBTC.b\n\nIn Q4 2022, LayerZero, an Omnichain interoperability protocol that enables cross-chain applications, launched support for BTC.b. BTC.b is a token that represents Bitcoin on Avalanche and can be automatically bridged in Core. Compared to other natively bridged Bitcoin assets, BTC.b allows users to freely transfer native Bitcoin without relying on custodians.\n\nBTC.b adoption on Avalanche quickly grew after LayerZero’s support in Q4 2022. The BTC.b supply on Avalanche continued its long-term trend upward but declined from 6,961 to 6,056 (-13% QoQ) after high growth (64%) during Q1.\n\nNFTs\n\nAs was the case for many networks, the Avalanche NFT sector declined for the second consecutive quarter in both secondary sales volume (-38.3% QoQ) and the number of unique NFT buyers (-49.8% QoQ) during Q2.\n\nDespite declining secondary sales, Avalanche's developer ecosystem continued its efforts to expand its NFT sector.\n\nDuring Q1, the Avalanche ecosystem launched Avaissance, an initi",

      "title": "State of USDD Q2 2023",
      "content": "Key Insights\n\nUSDD traded tight to its peg in Q2, enabling $13 million of backing to accumulate in the PSM and the Curve pool to return to balance.\nAdoption metrics leveled out but did not show a meaningful increase from Q1, with volumes and holders roughly flat quarter over quarter.\nThe backing for USDD improved in Q2, thanks to BTC and TRX prices rising 7% and 15%, respectively. The stablecoin remains undercollateralized with non-TRX assets but is 171% collateralized including TRX assets.\n\nPrimer on USDD\n\nUSDD is an overcollateralized stablecoin issued by the TRON DAO Reserve (TDR), which is also the custodian. The TDR is made up of seven crypto-native institutions. USDD’s value is backed by the overcollateralization of crypto assets under the TDR, including BTC, USDT, USDC, and TRX. The peg is maintained through the Peg Stability Module (PSM), which allows 1:1 transfer of USDD for USDT, USDC, TUSD, and USDJ. The PSM’s USDD funding is controlled by the TRON DAO Reserve. USDD can be minted by the whitelisted institutions of the TDR by depositing TRX.\n\nWebsite / Twitter / Discord\n\nKey Metrics\n\n  \n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nUSDD Supply and TRX Deposit\n\nUSDD new issuance has not changed since Q3'22, but the PSMs have continued to fluctuate with volatility around the peg. Driven by stablecoin price volatility in Q1 brought on by USDC fears, the USDD supply fell to its base issuance level of 725 million. However, as USDD returned to peg, the PSM again became viable, adding 13 million USDD to the circulating supply.\n\nReserve Balances\n\nThe TRX balance in the deposit account remained unchanged while the TRX balance in the two reserve accounts increased very slightly. Similarly, the bitcoin backing USDD remained unchanged, while its value increased another 7% from price changes in Q1.\n\nAlthough USDD’s collateral ratio improved in Q2, thanks to price increases in both BTC and TRX, the non-TRX collateral ratio remained meaningfully below 1. Measuring only on-chain reserves, the non-TRX collateral ratio of USDD increased to 0.58 with BTC as the only reserve. Including the TRX deposited by TRON DAO Reserve, the collateral ratio rose to 1.71 at quarter end.\n\n  \n\nPeg and Support\n\nAfter its most volatile quarter since inception, USDD returned to tight trading in Q2. The fall in volatility was paired with a return to peg, after months of trading below 1. In Q2, USDD had its tightest trading range around its target peg since Q3’22.\n\n  \n\nThe peg stability can also be seen in USDD’s share of the USDD/3CRV pool on Curve. The TRON DAO Reserve uses this Curve pool to help maintain liquidity for USDD on Ethereum and to keep the stablecoin peg. The pool contains USDD and 3CRV, Curve’s DAI/USDC/USDT stablecoin pool.\n\nThe liquidity in the pool was flat for the quarter around $2.8 million, but its allocation returned to near 50/50 balance. The pool started Q2 with only 22% of liquidity in USDD and ended with over 47% in USDD.\n\nAfter nearly two quarters of no assets in the PSM, Q2 saw renewed interest as USDD returned to peg. When USDD trades above $1, users can buy USDT, USDC, TUSD, or USDJ and deposit them into the PSM for a 1:1 exchange of USDD. If the stablecoin is trading below its peers, then users can buy it for less than $1 and exchange it 1:1 with any asset in the PSM as long as the PSM is funded.  \n\nThe strength of USDD enabled the PSM to accumulate over $13 million of TUSD in Q2, aided by the <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/c27b7926-2816-4e62-8546-4b998e6018ea\">brief depeg</a> of TUSD. That event also drove $250 million of volume in the PSM for TUSD alone. The PSM was used to execute over $640 million of volume in Q2.\n\n  \n\nAdoption and Usage\n\nThe number of holders of USDD on TRON stayed just above 130,000 in Q1, though falling for the first quarter in USDD’s existence. The transaction volume of USDD on TRON seemed to level out just below $2 billion, although the average transaction size was 70% larger in Q2 than Q1. The low transaction volume could be reflective of the relatively low price volatility of USDD in Q1. For comparison, USDD volume spiked in previous quarters around times of uncertainty and depegging.\n\n  \n\nNearly 40% of the USDD on TRON participates in TRON Network’s largest DeFi protocols. JustLend was the leading lending protocol on TRON, with over 220 million USDD deposited to earn yield. Despite the ample supply, the borrowing demand for USDD was not commensurate in Q2, with only 5 million USDD borrowed at quarter’s end. SunSwap and SunCurve, the leading DEXs on TRON, made up 70 million, or nearly 10%, of the USDD on TRON. The remaining USDD on TRON was primarily in user wallets or other contract accounts.\n\n  \n\nQualitative Analysis\n\nDue to the volatility and concerns around USDC, the TDR paused USDC trading in the PSM on March 22. On April 18, USDD reopened its USDC PSMs. The pause was an important action for the team, because it avoided the possibility of unbacked USDD entering the market. With the concerns quelled, the team went on to increase the defensibility of the USDD peg by enabling USDC.\n\n  \nNear the end of April, USDD aligned with 8pay, enabling the processing of payments and salaries in USDD. This integration signified a significant adoption step, positioning USDD as a viable option for real-world financial transactions.\n\nThe first day of May marked the one-year anniversary of USDD. Coinciding with this milestone, USDD launched a Footprint Analytics Dashboard, which provides a holistic view of USDD integrations across the wider ecosystem.\n\nSource\n\n  \nThe USDD team made progress in its mission to make USDD ubiquitous and easy-to-use across platforms. Throughout the quarter, USDD had several announcements of integrations and partnerships:\n\nOn May 24, the stablecoin expanded its collaboration with digital platforms by getting listed on Uquid, a leading e-commerce site.\nJune started on a strong note with USDD being added to the OKSE wallet.\nOn June 8, Stargate extended its support to USDD, which enlarged the scope and reach of the stablecoin.\nJune 16, brought more liquidity and ease for users as Rangers Protocol, a new Ethereum-Binance bridge, enabled USDD bridging.\nJune 21 saw the integration of USDD into the BeingFi wallet, dubbed \"The bridge to web3 gaming.\"\nNear the end of the month, on June 29, USDD was listed on Carbon Browser\nIt also announced an integration with FoxWallet. Both of these developments brought more platform diversity and practical options for USDD users.\n\nQ2 also brought on the introduction of governance for USDD. On May 10, the TRON DAO Reserve activated the first governance proposal where TRX holders could participate in voting. The vote passed on May 13, but not without some confusion from the community. The proposal enables TRX from the “burn contract” (what we call the deposit contract) and the reserve contract to be staked as sTRX and used in TRON governance.\n\nFor many users, it was the first time they learned the burn contract was not a burn address but instead a wallet controlled by the TRON DAO Reserve. The USDD team published an explanation prior to the closing of the vote on May 12 to clarify the mechanics of the system. They explain that \"The TRX Burning Contract was deployed just prior to the collapse of Terra UST. In response to community concerns following the Terra Death Spiral, USDD promptly shifted from an algorithmic approach to the over-collateralization model we have now. But the \"burn\" naming remains unchanged since the smart contract was already live on mainnet.\"\n\n  \nIn sum, Q2 2023 was highly dynamic for USDD, marked by collaborations, integrations, anniversary celebrations, and its first governance vote.\n\nClosing Summary\n\nThe second quarter saw the TRON-native stablecoin return to peg and trade with significantly reduced volatility. Paired with volatility in other assets like TUSD, USDD managed to attract over $13 million to the PSM along with an increase in its supply. Holders would also be pleased to see the Curve pool return to balance in the quarter. The volume and the number of transactions did not make any meaningful increases this quarter, and DeFi usage remained steady. At current prices, BTC’s backing alone is insufficient to maintain USDD. That said, the TRON DAO Reserve does have sufficient TRX in the deposit account and reserve accounts, at current prices, to back USDD dollar for dollar.",

      "title": "State of ApeCoin Q2 2023",
      "content": "Key Insights\n\nAPE trade volume was dominated by sharks ($1 million – $10 million in daily trading), which flipped whales (over $10 million in daily trading) for the first time since APE launched.\nThroughout Q2’23, roughly 25 million APE was unlocked to non-DAO entities and almost 26 million APE was claimed by Yuga ecosystem asset and APE holders. The average APE price dropped by 32%, potentially due to the sell pressure from over 50 million APE unlocked to non-DAO entities and claimed by users in Q2’23.\nTwo new Special Council members were elected in Q2’23, transitioning the power of special roles within the ApeCoin DAO.\nWebSlinger experienced its first full quarter as the administrator of the APE Foundation after beginning its term in March 2023.\nAll of ApeCoin’s key metrics fell QoQ, though daily token transfers, votes per governance proposal, and transfer volume remained higher than in certain previous quarters. Average DEX swap size and the addition of new APE holders hit all-time lows in Q2’23.\n\nPrimer on ApeCoin\n\nApeCoin (APE) is an ERC-20 token used for governance of the ApeCoin DAO. Holding any amount of APE qualifies the holder as an ApeCoin DAO member. Members create and vote on ApeCoin Improvement Proposals (AIPs) that encompass Ecosystem Fund distribution, governance rules, partnerships, and more. Third-party developers can incorporate APE into their respective projects.\n\nAPE is the adopted token of the APE Foundation, a legal entity that administers the decisions of the ApeCoin DAO. The APE Foundation also has a Special Council, called the DAO’s Board, to perform certain functions within the governance process. The operations of the APE Foundation are run by transient administrative entities elected by members of the ApeCoin DAO.\n\nThe ApeCoin DAO and the APE Foundation are separate entities from Yuga Labs, the creator of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and associated NFTs. Below is a breakdown of the relevant entities associated with the APE token.\n\nApeCoin DAO — A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) made up of APE holders that create and vote on AIPs.\nAPE Foundation — A legal entity incorporated in the Cayman Islands that administers the decisions of the ApeCoin DAO. Consists of the Special Council and a third-party project management team also called an administrator.\nSpecial Council (the DAO’s Board) — Five individuals that oversee the APE Foundation’s administrators, can approve grants outside of the AIP process, and perform certain functions within the ApeCoin DAO governance process. The current Special Council members are listed below.\n  Bored Ape G\n  Gerry\n  Vera Li\n  Waabam (newly elected)\n  CaptainTrippy (newly elected)\nCartan Group — The first and former administrator of the APE Foundation. Registered in the Cayman Islands.\nWebSlinger — Current administrator of the APE Foundation; started its 12-month renewing agreement on March 1, 2023. Based in the Cayman Islands.\nYuga Labs — A Web3 company responsible for creating the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). Yuga Labs is a contributor to ApeCoin and plans to use APE as the primary token in future projects like Otherside, an NFT-based game incorporating APE and Yuga Labs IP co-developed by Yuga Labs and Improbable.\n\nThe APE Foundation, the DAO’s Board, and WebSlinger are the primary entities that ensure the implementation of relevant passed ApeCoin DAO proposals (AIPs). Yuga Labs is largely an associated third-party developer facilitating the adoption of the APE token by incorporating it into its future projects.\n\nWebsite / Twitter / Snapshot\n\nKey Metrics\n\nApeconometrics\n\nAll ApeCoin key metrics fell in Q2’23. The fall in transfer velocity simply means there was less movement of the APE asset (it changed hands less) — this could indicate that users are holding as the bear market continues. While the average number of votes and token transfers decreased QoQ from prior highs, nominal values were above a couple previous quarters for each metric.\n\nRegarding financials, the price of APE fell by 32%, worse than the market’s single-digit decline. This price decline contributed significantly to the decline in transfer volume and DEX swap size, both measured in USD terms. While the amount of APE transferred also decreased, the amount of APE swapped increased (possibly to compensate for the fall in APE-USD price).\n\nThis report analyzes the metrics and events that explain the health of the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nFDV\n\nChanges in fully diluted valuation (FDV) reflect an asset’s price. Moreover, tracking FDV complements price volatility with a sense of scale for the asset’s significance.\n\nAPE’s fully diluted valuation hit a $2 billion floor at the end of Q2’23, a 91% drop from its all-time high in Q2’22. Despite the drop in price and valuation, ApeCoin DAO pushed forward, approving roughly the same number of proposals from the previous quarter and with slightly less funding ($1.89 million in Q2’23 versus $1.94 million in Q1’23).\n\nAPE Liquid Supply\n\nLiquid supply curves help determine when an increase in sell pressure may occur for certain assets (or, when tokens may get dumped onto unsuspecting buyers). Specifically, they show when tokens unlock and to whom.\n\nA total of 46.8 million APE was unlocked in Q2’23, of which 24.8 million APE was unlocked to non-DAO entities, including Yuga Labs, Yuga Labs Founders, three groups of Launch Contributors (unnamed entities that helped initially build ApeCoin DAO), and the Jane Goodall Legacy Foundation.\n\nThe unlock to non-DAO entities represents 5% of the circulating supply. This amount of sell pressure could have contributed to the steady decline in price throughout the quarter, where the quarter-end FDV fell by 24% and the average price by 32%.\n\nClaimed Staking Rewards\n\nApeCoin DAO issued staking rewards in Q4’22 after passing AIP-21 and AIP-22. APE holders and Yuga Labs’ ecosystem projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), and Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAKC) received staking allocations.\n\nStaking was implemented in early December 2022 and will last for three years, ultimately distributing 175 million APE (17.5% of the max supply) to Yuga ecosystem asset and APE holders. While 31.4 million APE was claimed in Q1’23, 25.8 million APE was claimed in Q2’23. In addition to the APE unlocked to non-DAO entities, the sell pressure from the claimed APE may have also contributed to the decline in APE price and FDV.\n\nHolder Count by Account Size\n\nWe have defined account size according to the specifications in our Dune dashboard. Using the 90-day average APE price (on June 30, 2023) of ~$3.37, the size denominations are split as per the legend in the chart below.\n\nAll accounts grew in Q2’23, leading to a total growth of 8%. Krill holders, again, accounted for the largest increase, growing by 9%. Seal-sized accounts were the only group to change by less than 2%, growing by almost 2%. The growth among all account sizes can likely be explained by the wider distribution of assets via the unlocking of 46.8 million APE and the claiming of 25.8 million APE in staking rewards in Q2’23.\n\nAccording to Etherscan, 250 holders account for ~97% of the maximum APE supply. However, not all large holders are liquid. At least 102 of the accounts are wallets controlled by the APE Foundation. According to the APE Foundation Transparency Report (pg. 13–15), it maintains 100 Coinbase Prime wallets and two Gnosis Safe wallets. Hence, at least 27% of the Whale wallets — based on the numbers in the Transparency Report — are maintained by the APE Foundation.\n\nVolume by Trade Size\n\nVolume by trade size shows what percentage of the trading volume is dominated by trades of various sizes. For example, if the total volume were $200 million and two wallets traded $50 million each (a total of $100 million), then the wallets with a volume of $50 million would account for 50% of the trading volume.\n\nThe decrease in whale trade volume (accounts with 1-day trading volumes of greater than $10 million) led to increases in all other APE trading groups. For the first time, shark trade volume (between $1 million and $10 million) overtook whale trade volume, accounting for 43% of the total APE trade volume.\n\nThis shift in whale volume to other groups may be in part due to the 32% QoQ decrease in average APE price. The largest shifts in the percentage of trade volume occurred at the top, with shark volume increasing by 9%, dolphin volume by 7%, seal volume by 3%, fish volume by 1%, and krill volume by less than 1%.\n\nToken Velocity\n\nToken velocity shows the frequency through which an asset changes hands (or wallets). A change in token velocity can show a few things depending on the asset. If the asset is consumptive, such as a token used within a game, an increase in token velocity may imply that the game encourages the adoption/use of the asset. If the asset is more speculative, then a decrease may imply that users are more interested in holding the asset or that it has low demand. In the chart below, token velocity is calculated by dividing the circulating supply by the seven-day moving average (7DMA) of transfer volume.\n\nToken velocity became more stable in Q2’23 as the average quarterly token velocity decreased from 6% to less than 4%. APE usage isn’t solely dependent on transferring the asset, but it also factors in how often APE is traded. Thus, the decrease in velocity indicates that users are generally trading and transferring the asset less frequently than in the previous quarter.\n\nA lower token velocity may indicate that users are holding APE during the bear market. It may also indicate that users are awaiting new uses for the asset, like in the pending launch of the Otherside game by Yuga. Users are also encouraged to keep their APE for governance participation (which only requires holding APE). Proposals increased by 42% QoQ, leading to more governance votes and possibly indicating a stronger desire to hold the",

      "title": "State of Venus Q2 2023",
      "content": "Key Insights\n\nVenus experienced its fourth consecutive quarter of interest revenue growth, generating $2.3 million for the DAO and $9.2 million for depositors.\nA 32% drop in the price of BNB following SEC charges against various Binance entities affected the total value of assets on Venus, leading to a 12% quarter-over-quarter decrease in total value supplied.\nVenus continued to ship its V4 features, including isolated pools and Resilient Price Feeds to enhance the platform's security, flexibility, and reliability.\nAdjustments to the interest rate parameters led to higher borrow rates and a decline in user activity in Q2, including a lower-than-usual spike in activity during the Maverick Launchpool event.\n\n  \n\nPrimer on Venus\n\nVenus is a decentralized money market protocol on the BNB Chain that facilitates depositing and borrowing of various cryptoassets. The interest rates for these assets are set algorithmically using an interest rate model that triggers updates based on the proportion of deposited assets lent. This is known as the utilization ratio. The protocol is managed by the Venus DAO community and governed by the XVS token. Users can stake the governance token in a vault to participate in governance and receive a portion of the protocol revenue.  \n\nWebsite / Twitter / Discord\n\nKey Metrics\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nUsage\n\nThe Venus protocol saw a decline in user activity in Q2, marked by the 9% and 10% QoQ decreases in the number of active borrowers and active depositors, respectively. The fall was largely due to adjustments to the interest rate parameters, which ultimately led to higher borrow rates and subsequently dampened the profitability of leverage strategies.\n\nThe Binance Launchpool event, typically a driver of borrowing activity on Venus, also demonstrated the impact of these modifications. Historically, Venus has seen a 100%-200% surge in active borrowers during such events. However, activity didn't spike upon initiation of the Maverick Launchpool in June. Additionally, on June 10, BNB borrowing fell to lows not experienced since January 2021, with only 89,140 units of BNB borrowed.\n\nTotal Value Supplied\n\nThe total value supplied on Venus experienced a 12% QoQ decrease, even as most cryptoasset prices remained relatively stable. This dip was primarily attributable to a 32% drop in the price of BNB, following the Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) decision to file 13 civil charges against various Binance entities. The fallout of this regulatory action impacted the value of assets held on Venus with every non-stablecoin asset experiencing outflows except for BTC, XVS, CAKE, ADA, and MATIC.\n\nRevenue\n\nInterest revenues climbed for the fourth consecutive quarter, reaching $11.5 million. This growth during Q2 was largely due to the further adjustment of interest rate curves as recommended by Gauntlet and the sustained borrowing activities that remain relatively insensitive to rate changes. These adjustments boosted the protocol's interest revenues by 33% and depositor revenues by 14%.\n\nWithin this revenue growth, BNB stood out as its revenues surged by 70% QoQ. This uptick will likely continue provided the depositor yields from Binance Launchpool events can retain their high level, and provided the BSC Token Hub exploiter's position does not fall to liquidation levels.\n\nDuring Launchpool events, large amounts of stablecoins are deposited, and the maximum amount of BNB is borrowed. By holding BNB on Binance Exchange, users can receive tokens from new projects.\n\nBy the end of the quarter, the exploiter’s position was approximately 10% away from being subject to liquidation (liquidatable with BNB at ~$220). It landed in this position following $1.3 million of interest expensed on USDC and USDT loans in Q2, and a depositor yield of around ~11,000 BNB (which depreciated with the price of BNB).  \n\nAvailable Liquidity\n\nBy the end of the quarter, liquidity valued at $647 million remained available for borrowing, with BTC and BNB collectively contributing to 76% of that value. The high utilization of stablecoins largely comes from the outsized position held by the BSC Token Hub attacker, which constitutes 59% of the total outstanding USDT debt and 64% of USDC debt.\n\nFurthermore, a significant portion of the outstanding loans has been outstanding since the liquidation events involving CAN, XVS, and LUNA in 2021 and 2022. Specifically, at least 95% of the BTC loan balance, 24% of the BUSD balance, and 29% of the ETH balance have not been repaid and are currently undercollateralized. Not including the debt of the BSC Token Hub attacker, Venus currently has $83 million of bad debt in the protocol. Collectively, these debts of $238 million represent nearly half of the total outstanding loan value on Venus. With its focus on managing the debt, the Venus team has stated it is almost ready to ship new smart contract automations for repaying shortfalls with interest income.\n\nRevenue vs. XVS Rewards\n\nIn the second quarter, protocol interest and liquidation revenues surpassed the XVS incentives disbursed to users by a margin of $800,000. This surplus was largely generated during the SUI Launchpool and Open Campus Launchpad events. They accounted for 68% of the quarterly interest revenue as represented by the spikes in interest revenue.\n\nHowever, the Maverick Launchpool event, which commenced on June 14, didn't exhibit a corresponding surge in interest revenues. This suggests that BNB leverage may have been sourced from other platforms, despite the BNB borrow rate on Venus hitting a yearly low.\n\nThe effect of Gauntlet’s interest curve optimizations, implemented on June 1, is also evident. Following the adjustments, daily interest revenues in June saw a significant uptick of 34% compared to May, after isolating to after the SUI Launchpool on May 3. The interest curve modifications had a positive impact on revenue generation, affirming the importance of managing borrowing costs on the platform.  \n\nXVS Vault\n\nIn addition to $354,000 in base rewards, XVS stakers received $350,000 in XVS tokens from protocol revenue distributions. While base rewards saw a considerable surge of 46%, revenue distributions experienced a drop of 36%. The enactment of VIP-113 effectively doubled the daily base rewards from 525 to 1,100 XVS. Additionally, the vault saw a net outflow of 290,000 XVS compared to a net inflow of 337,000 XVS in Q1. The proposal also included the following expectations about getting back to 9% APR in the next quarter:\n\n\"Due to various ongoing changes and audits, we were not able to adjust the XVS Vault distribution APR until today and more XVS have been distributed in the earlier weeks, thus the need to further lower the APR for the remainder of this quarter to compensate for the extra XVS that were already distributed. We expect the APR will return to above 9% in our next Quarter due to the excellent performances Venus has seen over the past few weeks.\"\n\nBorrower Perspective\n\nOverall, BNB Borrow rates experienced the largest increase out of the categories above, with the daily average increasing by 2.8 percentage points in Q2. However, from May 12 to June 12, the XVS incentives earned from BNB borrowing outweighed the cost of borrowing by an average of 36 basis points. When this happens, users borrowing BNB effectively receive boosted yields,  assuming prices remain constant. In short, these users earn positive returns on both their collateral and loans. While the average stablecoin borrow rate remained relatively flat, elevated rates at the end of the quarter look to be sticky due to withdrawn liquidity.  \n\nQualitative Analysis\n\nIsolated Pools\n\nThe Venus team continues to roll out new features and is moving closer to realizing the Venus V4 vision. One of the Q2 developments was the introduction of the \"isolated pool\" feature, including categories such as stablecoins, DeFi, Liquid Staked BNB, GameFi, and TRON as well as the initial support for nearly 20 new markets.\n\nThese isolated pools are separate from the Venus Core Pool. Instead, they represent individual lending markets with unique parameters. The creation of these isolated pools expands the horizons for users, offering a broader spectrum of assets to leverage within the DeFi space and beyond.\n\nSource: Venus\n\nAs shown above, Venus’ isolated pools offer various advantages over traditional pools. Foremost, isolated pools promise an extra layer of security because disturbances in one pool do not ripple across to others within the protocol. With systematic risks being mitigated, users can better assess their investment considerations based on a specific pool. This flexibility empowers users to better align their investments with their financial goals.\n\nContinuing on this trajectory, Venus is set to release the second stage of isolated lending in Q3, featuring the launch of four new isolated pools in categories such as DeFi, GameFi, Liquid Staking BNB, and TRON.\n\nResilient Price Feeds\n\nIn Q2, Venus V4 reached another significant milestone with the introduction of Resilient Price Feeds via VIP-123.\n\nSource: Venus\n\nResilient Price Feeds provide an additional layer of security to the Venus protocol by incorporating multiple oracle support, sense checking, and fallback mechanisms. Their design primarily aims to eradicate the risk of a single point of failure when fetching real-time asset prices.\n\nFor context, when LUNA was included as a collateral asset on Venus in May 2022, it was exclusively dependent on Chainlink price feeds for real-time pricing updates. This LUNA price feed contract was hard-coded with a minimum value of approximately $0.10, accompanied by a circuit breaker that halted pricing updates once this threshold was reached.\n\nWhen LUNA's market price significantly fell below its hard-coded minimum of $0.10, the Venus market continued to process transactions at this minimum value, due to the lack of stale price detection in the Venus market.
