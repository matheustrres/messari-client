      "content": "Key Insights\n\nUSDD traded tight to its peg in Q2, enabling $13 million of backing to accumulate in the PSM and the Curve pool to return to balance.\nAdoption metrics leveled out but did not show a meaningful increase from Q1, with volumes and holders roughly flat quarter over quarter.\nThe backing for USDD improved in Q2, thanks to BTC and TRX prices rising 7% and 15%, respectively. The stablecoin remains undercollateralized with non-TRX assets but is 171% collateralized including TRX assets.\n\nPrimer on USDD\n\nUSDD is an overcollateralized stablecoin issued by the TRON DAO Reserve (TDR), which is also the custodian. The TDR is made up of seven crypto-native institutions. USDD’s value is backed by the overcollateralization of crypto assets under the TDR, including BTC, USDT, USDC, and TRX. The peg is maintained through the Peg Stability Module (PSM), which allows 1:1 transfer of USDD for USDT, USDC, TUSD, and USDJ. The PSM’s USDD funding is controlled by the TRON DAO Reserve. USDD can be minted by the whitelisted institutions of the TDR by depositing TRX.\n\nWebsite / Twitter / Discord\n\nKey Metrics\n\n  \n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nUSDD Supply and TRX Deposit\n\nUSDD new issuance has not changed since Q3'22, but the PSMs have continued to fluctuate with volatility around the peg. Driven by stablecoin price volatility in Q1 brought on by USDC fears, the USDD supply fell to its base issuance level of 725 million. However, as USDD returned to peg, the PSM again became viable, adding 13 million USDD to the circulating supply.\n\nReserve Balances\n\nThe TRX balance in the deposit account remained unchanged while the TRX balance in the two reserve accounts increased very slightly. Similarly, the bitcoin backing USDD remained unchanged, while its value increased another 7% from price changes in Q1.\n\nAlthough USDD’s collateral ratio improved in Q2, thanks to price increases in both BTC and TRX, the non-TRX collateral ratio remained meaningfully below 1. Measuring only on-chain reserves, the non-TRX collateral ratio of USDD increased to 0.58 with BTC as the only reserve. Including the TRX deposited by TRON DAO Reserve, the collateral ratio rose to 1.71 at quarter end.\n\n  \n\nPeg and Support\n\nAfter its most volatile quarter since inception, USDD returned to tight trading in Q2. The fall in volatility was paired with a return to peg, after months of trading below 1. In Q2, USDD had its tightest trading range around its target peg since Q3’22.\n\n  \n\nThe peg stability can also be seen in USDD’s share of the USDD/3CRV pool on Curve. The TRON DAO Reserve uses this Curve pool to help maintain liquidity for USDD on Ethereum and to keep the stablecoin peg. The pool contains USDD and 3CRV, Curve’s DAI/USDC/USDT stablecoin pool.\n\nThe liquidity in the pool was flat for the quarter around $2.8 million, but its allocation returned to near 50/50 balance. The pool started Q2 with only 22% of liquidity in USDD and ended with over 47% in USDD.\n\nAfter nearly two quarters of no assets in the PSM, Q2 saw renewed interest as USDD returned to peg. When USDD trades above $1, users can buy USDT, USDC, TUSD, or USDJ and deposit them into the PSM for a 1:1 exchange of USDD. If the stablecoin is trading below its peers, then users can buy it for less than $1 and exchange it 1:1 with any asset in the PSM as long as the PSM is funded.  \n\nThe strength of USDD enabled the PSM to accumulate over $13 million of TUSD in Q2, aided by the <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/c27b7926-2816-4e62-8546-4b998e6018ea\">brief depeg</a> of TUSD. That event also drove $250 million of volume in the PSM for TUSD alone. The PSM was used to execute over $640 million of volume in Q2.\n\n  \n\nAdoption and Usage\n\nThe number of holders of USDD on TRON stayed just above 130,000 in Q1, though falling for the first quarter in USDD’s existence. The transaction volume of USDD on TRON seemed to level out just below $2 billion, although the average transaction size was 70% larger in Q2 than Q1. The low transaction volume could be reflective of the relatively low price volatility of USDD in Q1. For comparison, USDD volume spiked in previous quarters around times of uncertainty and depegging.\n\n  \n\nNearly 40% of the USDD on TRON participates in TRON Network’s largest DeFi protocols. JustLend was the leading lending protocol on TRON, with over 220 million USDD deposited to earn yield. Despite the ample supply, the borrowing demand for USDD was not commensurate in Q2, with only 5 million USDD borrowed at quarter’s end. SunSwap and SunCurve, the leading DEXs on TRON, made up 70 million, or nearly 10%, of the USDD on TRON. The remaining USDD on TRON was primarily in user wallets or other contract accounts.\n\n  \n\nQualitative Analysis\n\nDue to the volatility and concerns around USDC, the TDR paused USDC trading in the PSM on March 22. On April 18, USDD reopened its USDC PSMs. The pause was an important action for the team, because it avoided the possibility of unbacked USDD entering the market. With the concerns quelled, the team went on to increase the defensibility of the USDD peg by enabling USDC.\n\n  \nNear the end of April, USDD aligned with 8pay, enabling the processing of payments and salaries in USDD. This integration signified a significant adoption step, positioning USDD as a viable option for real-world financial transactions.\n\nThe first day of May marked the one-year anniversary of USDD. Coinciding with this milestone, USDD launched a Footprint Analytics Dashboard, which provides a holistic view of USDD integrations across the wider ecosystem.\n\nSource\n\n  \nThe USDD team made progress in its mission to make USDD ubiquitous and easy-to-use across platforms. Throughout the quarter, USDD had several announcements of integrations and partnerships:\n\nOn May 24, the stablecoin expanded its collaboration with digital platforms by getting listed on Uquid, a leading e-commerce site.\nJune started on a strong note with USDD being added to the OKSE wallet.\nOn June 8, Stargate extended its support to USDD, which enlarged the scope and reach of the stablecoin.\nJune 16, brought more liquidity and ease for users as Rangers Protocol, a new Ethereum-Binance bridge, enabled USDD bridging.\nJune 21 saw the integration of USDD into the BeingFi wallet, dubbed \"The bridge to web3 gaming.\"\nNear the end of the month, on June 29, USDD was listed on Carbon Browser\nIt also announced an integration with FoxWallet. Both of these developments brought more platform diversity and practical options for USDD users.\n\nQ2 also brought on the introduction of governance for USDD. On May 10, the TRON DAO Reserve activated the first governance proposal where TRX holders could participate in voting. The vote passed on May 13, but not without some confusion from the community. The proposal enables TRX from the “burn contract” (what we call the deposit contract) and the reserve contract to be staked as sTRX and used in TRON governance.\n\nFor many users, it was the first time they learned the burn contract was not a burn address but instead a wallet controlled by the TRON DAO Reserve. The USDD team published an explanation prior to the closing of the vote on May 12 to clarify the mechanics of the system. They explain that \"The TRX Burning Contract was deployed just prior to the collapse of Terra UST. In response to community concerns following the Terra Death Spiral, USDD promptly shifted from an algorithmic approach to the over-collateralization model we have now. But the \"burn\" naming remains unchanged since the smart contract was already live on mainnet.\"\n\n  \nIn sum, Q2 2023 was highly dynamic for USDD, marked by collaborations, integrations, anniversary celebrations, and its first governance vote.\n\nClosing Summary\n\nThe second quarter saw the TRON-native stablecoin return to peg and trade with significantly reduced volatility. Paired with volatility in other assets like TUSD, USDD managed to attract over $13 million to the PSM along with an increase in its supply. Holders would also be pleased to see the Curve pool return to balance in the quarter. The volume and the number of transactions did not make any meaningful increases this quarter, and DeFi usage remained steady. At current prices, BTC’s backing alone is insufficient to maintain USDD. That said, the TRON DAO Reserve does have sufficient TRX in the deposit account and reserve accounts, at current prices, to back USDD dollar for dollar.",

      "content": "Key Insights\n\nAPE trade volume was dominated by sharks ($1 million – $10 million in daily trading), which flipped whales (over $10 million in daily trading) for the first time since APE launched.\nThroughout Q2’23, roughly 25 million APE was unlocked to non-DAO entities and almost 26 million APE was claimed by Yuga ecosystem asset and APE holders. The average APE price dropped by 32%, potentially due to the sell pressure from over 50 million APE unlocked to non-DAO entities and claimed by users in Q2’23.\nTwo new Special Council members were elected in Q2’23, transitioning the power of special roles within the ApeCoin DAO.\nWebSlinger experienced its first full quarter as the administrator of the APE Foundation after beginning its term in March 2023.\nAll of ApeCoin’s key metrics fell QoQ, though daily token transfers, votes per governance proposal, and transfer volume remained higher than in certain previous quarters. Average DEX swap size and the addition of new APE holders hit all-time lows in Q2’23.\n\nPrimer on ApeCoin\n\nApeCoin (APE) is an ERC-20 token used for governance of the ApeCoin DAO. Holding any amount of APE qualifies the holder as an ApeCoin DAO member. Members create and vote on ApeCoin Improvement Proposals (AIPs) that encompass Ecosystem Fund distribution, governance rules, partnerships, and more. Third-party developers can incorporate APE into their respective projects.\n\nAPE is the adopted token of the APE Foundation, a legal entity that administers the decisions of the ApeCoin DAO. The APE Foundation also has a Special Council, called the DAO’s Board, to perform certain functions within the governance process. The operations of the APE Foundation are run by transient administrative entities elected by members of the ApeCoin DAO.\n\nThe ApeCoin DAO and the APE Foundation are separate entities from Yuga Labs, the creator of the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC) and associated NFTs. Below is a breakdown of the relevant entities associated with the APE token.\n\nApeCoin DAO — A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) made up of APE holders that create and vote on AIPs.\nAPE Foundation — A legal entity incorporated in the Cayman Islands that administers the decisions of the ApeCoin DAO. Consists of the Special Council and a third-party project management team also called an administrator.\nSpecial Council (the DAO’s Board) — Five individuals that oversee the APE Foundation’s administrators, can approve grants outside of the AIP process, and perform certain functions within the ApeCoin DAO governance process. The current Special Council members are listed below.\n  Bored Ape G\n  Gerry\n  Vera Li\n  Waabam (newly elected)\n  CaptainTrippy (newly elected)\nCartan Group — The first and former administrator of the APE Foundation. Registered in the Cayman Islands.\nWebSlinger — Current administrator of the APE Foundation; started its 12-month renewing agreement on March 1, 2023. Based in the Cayman Islands.\nYuga Labs — A Web3 company responsible for creating the Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC). Yuga Labs is a contributor to ApeCoin and plans to use APE as the primary token in future projects like Otherside, an NFT-based game incorporating APE and Yuga Labs IP co-developed by Yuga Labs and Improbable.\n\nThe APE Foundation, the DAO’s Board, and WebSlinger are the primary entities that ensure the implementation of relevant passed ApeCoin DAO proposals (AIPs). Yuga Labs is largely an associated third-party developer facilitating the adoption of the APE token by incorporating it into its future projects.\n\nWebsite / Twitter / Snapshot\n\nKey Metrics\n\nApeconometrics\n\nAll ApeCoin key metrics fell in Q2’23. The fall in transfer velocity simply means there was less movement of the APE asset (it changed hands less) — this could indicate that users are holding as the bear market continues. While the average number of votes and token transfers decreased QoQ from prior highs, nominal values were above a couple previous quarters for each metric.\n\nRegarding financials, the price of APE fell by 32%, worse than the market’s single-digit decline. This price decline contributed significantly to the decline in transfer volume and DEX swap size, both measured in USD terms. While the amount of APE transferred also decreased, the amount of APE swapped increased (possibly to compensate for the fall in APE-USD price).\n\nThis report analyzes the metrics and events that explain the health of the ApeCoin ecosystem.\n\nPerformance Analysis\n\nFDV\n\nChanges in fully diluted valuation (FDV) reflect an asset’s price. Moreover, tracking FDV complements price volatility with a sense of scale for the asset’s significance.\n\nAPE’s fully diluted valuation hit a $2 billion floor at the end of Q2’23, a 91% drop from its all-time high in Q2’22. Despite the drop in price and valuation, ApeCoin DAO pushed forward, approving roughly the same number of proposals from the previous quarter and with slightly less funding ($1.89 million in Q2’23 versus $1.94 million in Q1’23).\n\nAPE Liquid Supply\n\nLiquid supply curves help determine when an increase in sell pressure may occur for certain assets (or, when tokens may get dumped onto unsuspecting buyers). Specifically, they show when tokens unlock and to whom.\n\nA total of 46.8 million APE was unlocked in Q2’23, of which 24.8 million APE was unlocked to non-DAO entities, including Yuga Labs, Yuga Labs Founders, three groups of Launch Contributors (unnamed entities that helped initially build ApeCoin DAO), and the Jane Goodall Legacy Foundation.\n\nThe unlock to non-DAO entities represents 5% of the circulating supply. This amount of sell pressure could have contributed to the steady decline in price throughout the quarter, where the quarter-end FDV fell by 24% and the average price by 32%.\n\nClaimed Staking Rewards\n\nApeCoin DAO issued staking rewards in Q4’22 after passing AIP-21 and AIP-22. APE holders and Yuga Labs’ ecosystem projects like Bored Ape Yacht Club (BAYC), Mutant Ape Yacht Club (MAYC), and Bored Ape Kennel Club (BAKC) received staking allocations.\n\nStaking was implemented in early December 2022 and will last for three years, ultimately distributing 175 million APE (17.5% of the max supply) to Yuga ecosystem asset and APE holders. While 31.4 million APE was claimed in Q1’23, 25.8 million APE was claimed in Q2’23. In addition to the APE unlocked to non-DAO entities, the sell pressure from the claimed APE may have also contributed to the decline in APE price and FDV.\n\nHolder Count by Account Size\n\nWe have defined account size according to the specifications in our Dune dashboard. Using the 90-day average APE price (on June 30, 2023) of ~$3.37, the size denominations are split as per the legend in the chart below.\n\nAll accounts grew in Q2’23, leading to a total growth of 8%. Krill holders, again, accounted for the largest increase, growing by 9%. Seal-sized accounts were the only group to change by less than 2%, growing by almost 2%. The growth among all account sizes can likely be explained by the wider distribution of assets via the unlocking of 46.8 million APE and the claiming of 25.8 million APE in staking rewards in Q2’23.\n\nAccording to Etherscan, 250 holders account for ~97% of the maximum APE supply. However, not all large holders are liquid. At least 102 of the accounts are wallets controlled by the APE Foundation. According to the APE Foundation Transparency Report (pg. 13–15), it maintains 100 Coinbase Prime wallets and two Gnosis Safe wallets. Hence, at least 27% of the Whale wallets — based on the numbers in the Transparency Report — are maintained by the APE Foundation.\n\nVolume by Trade Size\n\nVolume by trade size shows what percentage of the trading volume is dominated by trades of various sizes. For example, if the total volume were $200 million and two wallets traded $50 million each (a total of $100 million), then the wallets with a volume of $50 million would account for 50% of the trading volume.\n\nThe decrease in whale trade volume (accounts with 1-day trading volumes of greater than $10 million) led to increases in all other APE trading groups. For the first time, shark trade volume (between $1 million and $10 million) overtook whale trade volume, accounting for 43% of the total APE trade volume.\n\nThis shift in whale volume to other groups may be in part due to the 32% QoQ decrease in average APE price. The largest shifts in the percentage of trade volume occurred at the top, with shark volume increasing by 9%, dolphin volume by 7%, seal volume by 3%, fish volume by 1%, and krill volume by less than 1%.\n\nToken Velocity\n\nToken velocity shows the frequency through which an asset changes hands (or wallets). A change in token velocity can show a few things depending on the asset. If the asset is consumptive, such as a token used within a game, an increase in token velocity may imply that the game encourages the adoption/use of the asset. If the asset is more speculative, then a decrease may imply that users are more interested in holding the asset or that it has low demand. In the chart below, token velocity is calculated by dividing the circulating supply by the seven-day moving average (7DMA) of transfer volume.\n\nToken velocity became more stable in Q2’23 as the average quarterly token velocity decreased from 6% to less than 4%. APE usage isn’t solely dependent on transferring the asset, but it also factors in how often APE is traded. Thus, the decrease in velocity indicates that users are generally trading and transferring the asset less frequently than in the previous quarter.\n\nA lower token velocity may indicate that users are holding APE during the bear market. It may also indicate that users are awaiting new uses for the asset, like in the pending launch of the Otherside game by Yuga. Users are also encouraged to keep their APE for governance participation (which only requires holding APE). Proposals increased by 42% QoQ, leading to more governance votes and possibly indicating a stronger desire to hold the",
