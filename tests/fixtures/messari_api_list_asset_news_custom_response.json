      "content": "Key Insights\n\nAt the end of Q2, a vote passed to enact a token-based governance system using off-chain voting platform Snapshot. The system will bring greater utility to the SKL token and increase community ownership of the network.\nSKALE developers announced Levitation Protocol and SKALE G, which will bring zk-rollups to the SKALE network. The protocols are estimated to launch on mainnet in Q4 2023.\nPVP game CryptoBlades accounted for the majority of network usage in Q2. The game had a 67% share and 85% share of total SKALE transactions and daily active addresses, respectively.\nThe Nebula gaming Hub witnessed increased usage driven by the launches of games, most notably Untitled Platformer. The Hub’s average daily transactions and active addresses increased QoQ by 422% and 69%, respectively.\n\nPrimer on SKALE\n\nSKALE is a Layer-1 (L1) sidechain framework with pooled security. A set of Ethereum smart contracts manage several core network functions, including staking, validator orchestration, BLS key generation for each SKALE chain, and more. SKALE supports a network of configurable EVM-compatible, dapp, or general-purpose chains (SKALE chains). Each SKALE chain is secured by a rotating subset of SKALE’s pooled validator set. The SKALE V2 upgrade in Q2’22 brought interoperability between SKALE chains. \n\nSKALE also differentiates itself by offering zero gas fees to end users. To generate fees, the protocol instead collects subscription fees from developers to create a new SKALE chain. SKALE contributors SKALE Labs and the Network of Decentralized Economics (N.O.D.E.) Foundation are specifically targeting gaming and other retail use cases via their development and growth efforts. At the end of Q2’23, SKL tokenholders passed a proposal to initiate token-based governance over protocol parameters using off-chain governance platform Snapshot. For a full primer on SKALE, refer to our Initiation of Coverage <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/skaleing-with-evm-app-chains\">report</a>.\n\nWebsite / Twitter / Discord  \n\nKey Metrics\n\nFinancial Analysis\n\nQ2’23 was an up-and-down quarter for the overall crypto market. In the first half of the quarter, a <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/pepe-by-the-numbers?referrer=all-research\">meme coin</a> craze drove up on-chain activity and prices. After a brief period of relative calm, several U.S. regulatory events, including enforcement actions against <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/79ad00d4-9b49-40b0-b3e2-6173bd08863d\">Coinbase</a> and <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/e1fbfd61-f6af-412d-a1c4-9deea7a883bd\">Binance</a>, drove the market down. Among other claims, these enforcement actions alleged that several Layer-1 tokens are securities. BTC and ETH were not part of these allegations; thus, alt-L1 tokens generally experienced more negative price action.\n\nAlthough SKL was not named in any of the claims, it was still affected by the market downturn. Following a 107% QoQ rally in Q1’23, SKL’s market cap decreased 29% QoQ to $118 million. From quarter start to end, SKL’s market cap rank among all cryptocurrencies slightly fell from 168th to 171st.\n\nThe SKL token has three primary use cases: SKALE chain subscription fees, network security (via validator staking), and, starting at the end of Q2’23, governance.\n\nSubscription Fees\n\nSKALE has a unique revenue model because it subsidizes gas costs rather than charging the end user. SKALE still has a gas token (sFUEL) to combat network attacks like DDoS, but it does not have any monetary value and users can receive it from token faucets. To generate fees, the protocol instead charges developers an SKL subscription fee for creating their own SKALE chain. This subscription fee is distributed to validators (and then passed down to delegators). The subscription fee model is expected to evolve in the following three phases, subject to governance:\n\nPhase 1 emphasizes growth over revenue and is what the network’s been in since launch in October 2020. To incentivize growth in a loss leadership model, grants via the Protocol Development Fund have been utilized for the majority of chain payments. Furthermore, rather than distributing these tokens to validators, they were instead paid to a growth pool and distributed to developers and builders. Thus far, revenue has only included ETH payments made by chain owners to cover the gas costs of running a SKALE chain.\nPhase 2 is planned to commence in Q3 and run for 6 months. It will introduce a temporary fixed chain cost of $3,200 per chain per month in SKL tokens. This figure aims to increase the fees distributed to validators, which can offset inflationary pressure, without creating too high of a financial burden for developers.\nPhase 3 will introduce a dynamic chain cost. It targets a yearly cost at a certain network load, initially proposed at $1 million per chain per year in SKL tokens with the network at a 70% load. Network load is defined here as the percentage of total validator resources in use across every SKALE chain. A higher network load leads to a higher cost and vice versa. This is planned to launch in Q2’24, subject to governance.\n\nOver time, subscription fees aim to replace inflation as the primary payment to validators. SKL has a fixed total supply, allocating one-third of the supply to validator rewards. So far, around 40% of this allocation has been distributed. At the end of Q2’23, SKL’s annualized inflation was at 6%, and this rate will continue to decline until all tokens are liquid.\n\nAdditionally, inflationary pressure comes from token unlocks to other buckets of SKL’s initial distribution. Genesis supply liquid measures the percentage of tokens from the initial distribution that are liquid, excluding tokens for staking rewards. By the end of Q2’23, SKALE’s genesis supply liquid was at 76.7%, with another 1.9% unlocking in Q3’23 to its core contributors.\n\nNetwork Security Costs and Incentives\n\nSKALE validator operations, including staking and rotation, occur on Ethereum via the SKALE manager smart contract. The SKALE manager runs distributed key generation (DKG) to generate Boneh–Lynn–Shacham (BLS) keys for each node. In the past five quarters, this computational cost has outweighed revenue generated, by 41 to 32 ETH.\n\nWhile the vast majority of validator rewards currently comes from inflation, SKL’s real yield has still been positive since not all tokens are staked. By the end of Q2’23, SKL’s real yield was 5%, a 34% QoQ increase. The increase was driven by the 14% QoQ decrease in the percentage of SKL tokens staked to 55%.\n\nToken-Based Governance\n\nOn the last day of Q2’23, a Snapshot vote to institute a proposed governance system passed, with 1.3 billion SKL voting affirmatively. The proposal was initially posted in SKALE’s forum by TheGreatAxios, the lead community developer for the Calypso NFT Hub. It allows SKL stakers to vote on governance proposals, whose scope will initially include network economic parameters such as subscription fees, inflation, slashing penalties, minimum stake requirements, and more. At the moment, the scope will not encompass more off-chain agendas such as grants, marketing, business development, etc., but it could be expanded to include these in the future. Beyond scope, the passed proposal also outlines the governance process and parameters. Notably, only SKL that is staked can participate in governance, which could reverse the downward trend in the percent of supply staked seen in Q2’23.\n\nVoting will occur on off-chain voting platform Snapshot. In order to execute proposals on-chain, the plan is to use SafeSnap, a Snapshot plugin that integrates Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) with Snapshot. With SafeSnap, passed proposals will need to be executed on-chain by the owners of the Safe multi-sig. The Safe owners also have veto power over a passed proposal.\n\nOverall, the goal for the new system was to start simple, get it up and running, and then add in more complexities via governance as needed.\n\nNetwork Analysis\n\nUsage\n\nThe number of SKALE chains remained at 20 throughout Q2’23, with no chains created or deleted. Combined across all SKALE chains, average daily transactions decreased 33% QoQ to 211,000. However, from Q2 start to end, daily transactions gradually trended upward. Chain-level activity is covered in the Ecosystem Section below.\n\nSecurity and Decentralization\n\nThe number of SKALE validators has remained steady at 53 in the past year with a current total of 125 active nodes in the network. SKL rewards are split evenly among all validators assuming they meet performance criteria. This creates an incentive for an entity to operate more than one validator. At the end of Q2, there were 34 entities running validators.\n\nSKALE validator nodes are segmented into up to 128 virtualized subnodes via a containerized architecture. A validator can have its various subnodes acting as validators for up to eight different SKALE chains. The pool of virtualized subnodes rotates among SKALE chains, with assignments set by the SKALE manager smart contract on Ethereum. In Q2’23, there was a large increase in the number of node rotations compared to previous quarters, with the number of DKG transactions almost doubling QoQ.\n\nTotal staked (SKL) decreased 7% QoQ to 2.5 billion, but SKL staked has largely remained constant over the past year. Thus, changes in total staked (USD) have mainly been driven by SKL price action. Total staked (USD) decreased 39% QoQ to $64 million. At quarter end, four validators made up the top 33% of SKL staked.\n\nUpgrades and Roadmap\n\nMetaport Bridge\n\nThe SKALE V2 upgrade in Q2’22 brought interoperability between SKALE chains. But the user and developer experience was not optimal. In Q2’23, the Metaport bridge launched, offering an easy-to-use interface on top of the underlying SKALE Interchain Messaging Agent (IMA) bridge. Metaport enables token transfers between SKALE chains as well as to and from Ethereum. Developers can integrate the Metaport widget into their own application, allowing users to bridge without leaving the site.\n\nLevitation and SKALE G\n\nAt the beginning of June, SKALE developers announced a SKALE Improvement Proposal to bring zero-knowledge rollup technology to SKALE chains. The proposal includes both the Levitation protocol and SKALE Ganymede (SKALE G). The solutions will increase the amount of security on SKALE chains derived from Ethereum, further scaling capabilities, and introduce a different revenue model with gas fees.\n\nThe Levitation protocol aims to enable zk-rollups to connect to the SKALE Architecture with rollup connectivity to the Ethereum Mainnet. SKALE chains can use the existing gas-free SKALE architecture of Levitation’s zk solution in a configurable manner. Levitation proposes an arrangement where a decentralized sequencer is implemented as a collection of smart contracts deployed on a SKALE chain. The protocol features a modular design that facilitates the integration of various zk-rollups into chains that have implemented the Levitation Protocol.\n\nAdditionally, there are plans to launch a general-purpose zk-rollup called SKALE Ganymede (SKALE G). The Ganymede protocol plans to shift SKALE's cryptographic internals, like state root computation, to zero-knowledge cryptographic algorithms. This shift aims to \"enable fast ZK-proof generation\" and allow the verification of these ZK proofs on the Ethereum mainnet. Ganymede Protocol will also introduce weighted consensus, whereby each node in the system would have voting rights proportional to its total validator stake rather than an equal weight across all nodes.\n\nGanymede will also use aggregated BLS signatures with long-term BLS keys, eliminating the need for running Distributed Key Generation (DKG) rounds each time a node joins or leaves the chain. Transaction fees for Ganymede-enabled systems are expected to be non-zero due to its execution environment where multiple dApps interact on a single chain. However, the architecture aims to \"minimize transaction fees\" while maintaining compatibility with Ethereum transaction fee algorithms, particularly EIP-1559.\n\nThe development schedule for the Ganymede protocol includes the initial release of the source code in the following months, followed by the launch of a public testnet. The mainnet launch is expected in Q4 2023 but is subject to change based on execution by contributors to the SKALE Project. A successful on-chain vote will be required to push the source code proposal into production.\n\nEcosystem Analysis\n\nPopular Chains\n\nCryptoBlades was the most popular SKALE chain by daily transactions in Q2, averaging 142,000. CryptoBlades is a multichain play-to-earn PVP game.\n\nFollowing CryptoBlades was Web3 protocol Exorde at 47,000, a 69% QoQ decrease. Exorde is an information platform that incentivizes users to collect and submit data from social networks, which Exorde uses to create sentiment ratings, identify trends, and for other analytical tools. After launching in early October, Exorde incentivized network activity with a future airdrop, leading to spikes of high usage. In mid-April, Exorde migrated back to SKALE mainnet after several months of optimizations. Together, the two chains accounted for 90% of total SKALE transactions.\n\nGaming Hub Nebula’s average daily transactions increased 422% to 15,000. Nebula launched at the beginning of the year. The increase in transactions on Nebula was driven by the launches of several new games, most notably Untitled Platformer. Untitled Platformer features play-to-earn platform games. Other Q2 launches on Nebula include mobile RPG game CryptoCrusades and P2E game Mystrios. Additionally, sandbox-style game Prospectors, already live on Nebula, launched its VoxelVerse shop at the end of May.\n\nHUMAN Protocol, a decentralized marketplace connecting freelancers and businesses, launched as its own SKALE chain at the end of Q1. It averaged 1,000 daily active transactions in Q2.\n\nCryptoBlades averaged 11,000 daily active addresses in Q2’23, an 85% market share among SKALE chains. NFT Hub Calypso’s daily active addresses increased 68% QoQ to 97. Calypso aims to be the main liquidity and bridging layer for NFTs. Calypso development is being led by MyLilius, but plans are to eventually turn Calypso into a community-owned Hub. At the moment, the only application on Calypso is NFT marketplace NFTrade. There were no SKALE NFT sales on NFTrade in Q2.\n\nExorde led SKALE chains in average daily new addresses at 520. Calypso Hub followed, increasing its average daily new addresses 66% QoQ to 91. Despite its healthy lead in transaction and active address counts, CryptoBlades was third in average daily new addresses, decreasing 41% QoQ to 42.\n\nDeFi\n\nThe Europa Hub aims to solve potential liquidity fragmentation problems that arise with app-chain ecosystems by providing a central DeFi liquidity hub. Europa development is led by the Ruby Exchange team, with plans to eventually transition to a community-owned Hub.\n\nRuby Exchange is an AMM-based DEX that is the sole application on the Europa Hub. Ruby Exchange features a “4Pool” consisting of stablecoins USDP, DAI, USDT, and USDC. At the end of Q2, TVL in the 4Pool stood at $545,000, a 6% QoQ decrease. SKALE does not currently support any native stablecoins; each of the four is bridged from Ethereum. The Europa bridge employs a multisig on top of the underlying IMA bridge. The IMA bridge is trustless, as it uses the same mechanisms for security as SKALE’s consensus protocol. As such, the multisig can introduce additional trust assumptions depending on the level of control the chain owner gives to the multisig. The Europa bridge uses a 3/5 multisig with the following signers:\n\nRuby Exchange\nImpossible Finance, a launchpad not built on SKALE that facilitated the RUBY IDO on Binance Smart Chain\nBoot Finance, a DeFi protocol that planned to build on SKALE prior to a hack and that has not had any activity on its Twitter or Medium account since May 19\n01Node and Stakin, both staking operators on SKALE\n\nAs noted above, the Ruby Exchange team plans to move chain control to a community-owned, on-chain governance structure to minimize multisig-related attack vectors.\n\nBeyond the 4Pool, Ruby Exchange also features pools that pair USDP with another token, including RUBY, SKL, ETH, and more. At the end of Q2, TVL in these pools stood at $710,000, a 14% decrease.\n\nIn total, SKALE TVL fell 11% to $1.3 million. Given that the majority (all of the 4Pool plus half of all other pools) are in stablecoins, SKALE’s TVL is resilient to market downturns like the one in Q2.\n\nSince launch, Ruby Exchange has facilitated $13 million in trading volume. Near the end of June, Ruby Exchange announced an incentives campaign featuring 50,000 USDP and 1 million SKL for additional LP rewards over the subsequent month.\n\nNFTs and Gaming\n\nWith zero-gas fees, SKALE is especially suited for retail-focused NFT and gaming use cases. As highlighted above, many of the top applications on SKALE are games, including CryptoBlades, Untitled Platformer, and VoxelVerse. At the end of June, SKALE Labs announced SKALE Summer Splash, a gaming competition with 150,000 SKL in giveaways in the last week of June. Every day, users could receive 1 giveaway entry per game and per wallet used to record an on-chain transaction with the featured games. The four included games were CryptoCrusades, SKALE Platformer, Untitled Platformer, and VoxelVerse. The campaign led to the spikes in Nebula Hub activity seen in the above charts. For a deeper dive into the almost 20 games that are currently or planned to launch on SKALE, see SKALE’s blog.\n\nDevelopment and Growth\n\nDeveloper data is always imperfect, but Electric Capital’s Developer Report sets a foundational standard for measuring developer activity. It measures developers as authors who contribute original, open-source code to an ecosystem and full-time developers as those who do so 10+ days in a month. In May, the SKALE ecosystem had 10 full-time developers, a slight decrease from 11 in March.\n\nEcosystem partnerships and growth will be spearheaded mainly by the N.O.D.E. Foundation. In February 2022, the Foundation announced a $100 million ecosystem incentive program, from which it is still allocating to attract new projects and partners. In Q2, the Foundation signed up over 40 games and other Web3 products which they anticipate will go live by the end of 2023. These partnerships and new projects will be announced over time.\n\nClosing Summary\n\nAlthough overall SKALE network usage decreased in Q2, several chains and applications witnessed notable growth. The Nebula Hub’s average daily transactions and active addresses increased QoQ by 422% and 69%, respectively. The surges were spurred by several game launches including Untitled Platformer, CryptoCrusades, and Mystrios. Additionally, after launching at the end of Q1, decentralized freelancer marketplace HUMAN Protocol jumped into the top five SKALE chains with respect to transactions and new addresses.\n\nThe quarter featured two important protocol milestones: the enactment of a token-based governance structure and the announcement of Levitation Protocol and SKALE G. Token-based governance, set to occur on off-chain voting platform Snapshot, will bring greater utility to the SKL token and increase community-ownership of the network. The Levitation Protocol and SKALE G aim to bring zk-rollups to the SKALE network, furthering network scalability and its connection to Ethereum.",

      "content": "Key Insights\n\nPolygon Labs unveiled Polygon 2.0, a network of zero-knowledge Layer-2 blockchains. It aims to become the \"Value Layer of the Internet\" and brings significant updates to protocol architecture, tokenomics, and governance.\nPolygon zkEVM experienced steady growth, showcasing notable collaborations and integrations with industry players. By the end of the quarter, it achieved 200,000 unique addresses.\nDespite a hostile U.S. regulatory environment, Polygon’s network fundamentals were unaffected by the news.\nPolygon expanded its list of collaborations with prominent legacy companies and institutions, including Franklin Templeton, Securitize, Mastercard, and Warner Music Group. These additions complement an existing roster that includes Adobe, Adidas, Disney, Meta, Nike, Reddit, Robinhood, and Starbucks.\n\nPrimer on Polygon\n\nPolygon is a suite of Ethereum-based scaling solutions that allow developers to move computation and data storage off Ethereum and into low-fee, high-speed development environments. Polygon offers the following solutions:\n\nPolygon PoS - Polygon’s flagship product is the Polygon PoS network, a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) EVM-compatible sidechain for the Ethereum network.\nPolygon zkEVM - A Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Layer-2 rollup protocol for Ethereum that launched on mainnet beta on March 27, 2023. Polygon zkEVM aims to enable secure, quick, and cheap transactions. As a ZK-rollup, Polygon zkEVM bundles transactions into batches that are executed off-chain.\nPolygon Miden - Polygon Miden is an upcoming Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Layer-2 rollup protocol designed for Ethereum. Setting itself apart from zkEVM, Polygon Miden does not rely on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Instead, it utilizes the Miden Virtual Machine (MVM), written in Rust. This unique approach allows developers to build high-throughput and private applications using modern smart contract languages like Rust, offering enhanced safety and aiming for minimal fees, all while benefiting from the security of the Ethereum network.\nPolygon Supernets - An app-chain-focused scaling solution for Polygon PoS that is in testnet. Polygon Supernets aim to expand the block space of Polygon PoS by providing both Layer-2 and Layer-3 networks for specific applications. Polygon Supernets are EVM-compatible, allowing applications built on Polygon PoS to achieve greater throughput and cheaper transaction costs.\nPolygon ID - A privacy-preserving identification service for Web3 users. Polygon ID uses ZK-proofs to verify a user’s credentials privately without disclosing unwanted personal information.\n\n  \nIn June 2023, Polygon Labs unveiled Polygon 2.0, a network of zero-knowledge Layer 2 blockchains. It aims to become the \"Value Layer of the Internet\" and brings significant updates to protocol architecture, tokenomics, and governance. Polygon 2.0 is the future of the Polygon ecosystem.\n\nWebsite / Twitter / Discord\n\nKey Metrics\n\nPolygon 2.0\n\nIntroduction\n\nPolygon 2.0 represents a significant milestone in the evolution of the Polygon blockchain, aimed at establishing it as the Value Layer of the Internet. This set of enhancements covers multiple areas including protocol architecture, tokenomics, and governance. The end goal is the democratization of global economic access, by boosting decentralized finance, digital ownership, and innovative coordination mechanisms. In this segment, we delve into the core attributes and consequences of Polygon 2.0 that have been revealed thus far.\n\nUnlimited Scalability and Unified Liquidity\n\nThe core vision of Polygon 2.0 is to enable unlimited scalability and unified liquidity through the integration of zero-knowledge (ZK) technology. This upgrade aims to address the inherent scaling challenges faced by Web3, where the addition of new chains often results in fragmented liquidity and an underwhelming user experience. By leveraging ZK-powered Layer-2 (L2) chains and a novel cross-chain coordination protocol, Polygon 2.0 creates a unified network that offers practically boundless scalability and seamless cross-chain interactions.\n\nPolygon PoS Upgrade to zkEVM Validium\n\nAs part of the Polygon 2.0 upgrade, it is proposed for the Polygon Proof-of-Stake (PoS) chain to transition into a zkEVM validium. This change enables Polygon PoS to enhance its security, performance, and compatibility within the Polygon 2.0 ecosystem. With zkEVM validium, transaction data is made available off-chain, resulting in lower fees compared to traditional rollups, while maintaining robust security guarantees. The proposed timeline for the upgrade is as follows:\n\nJune 2023 - July 2023: Pre-PIP discussion and consensus\nOctober 2023 - November 2023: PIP publishing, discussion, and consensus\nNovember 2023 - January 2024: PIP implementation and testing\nFebruary 2024 - March 2024: Upgrade, i.e., PIP activation on mainnet\n\nProtocol Architecture\n\nThe architecture of Polygon 2.0 is a key element in realizing its vision. It is organized into four protocol layers, each serving a specific purpose:\n\nStaking Layer - Leverages Polygon's native token to provide staking services to participating chains. The Staking Layer is implemented on Ethereum via two contracts: the Validator Manager and the Chain Manager.\nInterop Layer - Facilitates cross-chain messaging within the Polygon ecosystem. It enables secure shared access to native Ethereum assets and near-instant and atomic cross-chain transactions.\nExecution Layer - Handles block production and transaction sequencing.\nProving Layer - Incorporates a highly performant ZK proving protocol for generating and verifying proofs across Polygon chains.\n\nTokenomics\n\nPolygon Labs has proposed a new native token, POL, as part of the Polygon 2.0 upgrade. The new POL token will be a 1:1 upgrade of the existing MATIC token and will inherit MATIC’s 10 billion supply as its initial supply.\n\nPOL will enable holders to become validators for multiple Polygon chains and receive rewards for a variety of services. This includes standard validation services, such as accepting user transactions and determining their validity, as well as broader services, such as producing zk validity proofs for transactions or providing data availability guarantees. Notably, each individual Polygon chain can offer customized roles and rewards for its validators. Validators can choose to validate multiple chains at once to compound their rewards in a similar manner to EigenLayer’s restaking offering on Ethereum.\n\nFinally, Polygon’s new token economic model removes the finite 10 billion supply cap on its native token. Instead, POL will switch to an inflationary model to incentivize validator participation and fund a community-governed treasury. Both categories are expected to receive 1% POL inflation for the next 10 years until the community determines whether to drop the inflation rates.\n\nGovernance\n\nPolygon Governance 2.0 introduces three main governance pillars for the Polygon ecosystem. Protocol Governance, System Smart Contract Governance, and Community Treasury Governance. Each pillar of governance will have its own unique governance framework, aiming to create scalable and efficient governance mechanisms.\n\nProtocol Governance: Facilitated by the Polygon Improvement Proposal (PIP) framework, providing a platform for proposing upgrades to Polygon protocols.\nSystem Smart Contracts Governance: Addresses upgrades of protocol components implemented as smart contracts. The Ecosystem Council, governed by the community, will be responsible for these upgrades.\nCommunity Treasury Governance: Establishes a self-sustainable ecosystem fund, the Community Treasury, to support public goods and ecosystem projects. The governance process involves two phases, starting with an independent Community Treasury Board and evolving into community-driven decision-making.\n\nFinancial Overview\n\nMarket Capitalization and Revenue\n\nPolygon's market capitalization experienced a significant surge in <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-polygon-q1-2023?referrer=asset:polygon\">Q1 2023</a>, reaching nearly $14 billion in mid-February. Although it retraced some of the gains, Polygon closed Q1’23 with a market cap of $9.92 billion, marking a 50% increase compared to the previous quarter and outperforming the broader market.\n\nHowever, during the second quarter, Polygon's market cap declined to $5.82 billion, reflecting a 41% QoQ decrease. Despite the market cap contraction, Polygon’s market cap was still up year-over-year.\n\nPolygon generates revenue from network fees, which remained relatively stable QoQ at $11.4 million, equivalent to an annualized revenue of $57 million.\n\nNote: Polygon 2.0 will bring significant changes to Polygon’s revenue and value accrual. See the Polygon 2.0 - Unlimited Scalability and Unified Liquidity section for further details.\n\nMATIC Token\n\nPolygon's native token, MATIC, serves multiple functions within the network:\n\nUsed as payment for network gas fees (Native MATIC on Polygon PoS)\nUsed as a medium of exchange throughout the Polygon ecosystem (Native MATIC and MRC-20 WMATIC on Polygon PoS)\nStaked to operate a validator (ERC-20 MATIC on Ethereum)\nDelegated to a validator (ERC-20 MATIC on Ethereum)\nUsed to reward validators (ERC-20 MATIC on Ethereum)\nGovernance on the Heimdall layer (ERC-20 MATIC on Ethereum)\n\nIn October, MATIC reached <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-polygon-q4-2022?referrer=asset:polygon\">full vesting</a>, with a total supply of 10 billion tokens. MATIC follows the EIP-1559 upgrade, which includes a mechanism that burns) a portion of every network transaction fee paid in native MATIC. The \"base fee,\" a fluctuating portion of the gas fee, is burned, while the remaining fee is distributed to the block's proposing validator as a \"priority fee\" or tip. To date, a total of 16 million MATIC has been burned through this mechanism.\n\nNote: Polygon 2.0 will replace the MATIC token with a new token called POL. See the Polygon 2.0 - Tokenomics section for further details.\n\nTreasury\n\nPolygon's Treasury concluded Q2 2023 with a holding of 1.80 billion MATIC tokens, amounting to a value of $1.12 billion. The Treasury is under the control of Polygon Technologies, which has strategically allocated the majority of its expenditures toward the scaling efforts of the Polygon network. These funds have been utilized for various purposes, including the acquisition of ZK-projects and teams, the development of ZK-based solutions, talent recruitment, and research funding.\n\nNote: Polygon 2.0 will fund a community-governed treasury with a new tokenomic model. See the Polygon 2.0 - Tokenomics section for further details.\n\nNetwork Overview\n\nUsage\n\nIn Q2, Polygon experienced a surge in average daily new addresses, increasing by 256% QoQ from 243,000 to 866,000. The network witnessed the creation of nearly 80 million new addresses throughout the quarter. This surge in new addresses coincided with the launch of the zkEVM, indicating heightened enthusiasm within the community.\n\nConversely, the number of transactions on the Polygon network experienced an 18% decline QoQ, decreasing from 2.9 million daily transactions to 2.4 million daily transactions. This decline in transaction volume directly corresponds to the launch of the zkEVM.\n\nDevelopment\n\nPolygon has demonstrated strong activity and commitment to the developer community. In <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-polygon-q4-2022?referrer=asset:polygon\">Q4 2022</a>, it hosted multiple events and signed partnerships to strengthen developer relationships. In <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-polygon-q1-2023?referrer=asset:polygon\">Q1</a>, the Polygon Labs @ the Pit (later renamed to DevX Global Tour) accelerator kicked off a global developer tour.\n\nIn Q2, Polygon continued the DevX Global Tour Hackathon. It visited Asian cities such as Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Kuala Lumpur, and allowed developers to compete for a share of $125,000 in bounties. The hackathon is going to Europe in July, visiting Amsterdam, Zagreb, London, Paris, Lisbon, and Berlin. Additionally during Q2, Polygon partnered with Google Cloud to offer resources and benefits to early-stage startups in the Polygon ecosystem. Polygon Copilot, an AI-powered tool to support developers, was also launched.\n\nPolygon saw a five-fold spike in deployed contracts in Q2, and it ranked sixth in developer activity through the first half of 2023 according to Electric Capital, boasting 201 full-time developers and 837 total developers.\n\nAdditional Solutions\n\nPolygon zkEVM\n\nPolygon zkEVM is a Layer-2 rollup protocol for Ethereum that launched on March 27, 2023. Polygon zkEVM aims to enable secure, quicker, and cheaper transactions. As a ZK-rollup, Polygon zkEVM bundles transactions into batches that are executed off-chain. After the transactions are executed off-chain, Polygon zkEVM publishes the transaction data on-chain. In addition to the data of the transactions, Polygon zkEVM also publishes a validity proof, which cryptographically verifies the correctness of the data published on-chain.\n\n  \nThroughout Q2, Polygon zkEVM experienced notable collaborations and integrations with industry players such as Celer Network, <a href=\"https://messari.io/intel/event/adcea043-f4d7-4afd-853e-1a37bb780581\">Synapse</a>, Balancer, and Uniswap (not yet operational). Additionally, Polygon unveiled the Polygon Bridge to zkEVM, enhancing connectivity within the ecosystem. Monthly reports were introduced to highlight zkEVM's activity and development progress\n\nDuring the quarter, Polygon zkEVM demonstrated consistent growth, boasting 200,000 unique addresses and a total of 1.8 million transactions (equivalent to approximately 19,700 daily transactions). However, it is important to note that the activity on zkEVM remains a fraction of that on the PoS chain. As the quarter concluded, Polygon zkEVM reported a TVL of $40 million, primarily driven by Quickswap's contribution of $20 million.\n\nPolygon Miden\n\nPolygon Miden is an upcoming Zero-Knowledge (ZK) Layer-2 rollup protocol designed for Ethereum. Setting itself apart from zkEVM, Polygon Miden does not rely on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Instead, it utilizes the Miden Virtual Machine (MVM), written in Rust. This unique approach allows developers to build high-throughput and private applications using modern smart contract languages like Rust, offering enhanced safety and aiming for minimal fees, all while benefiting from the security of the Ethereum network.\n\nIn anticipation of the Miden testnet launch, Polygon Labs has released a series of detailed blog posts explaining Polygon Miden. It introduces a unique Transaction Model with accounts, notes, and transactions, enabling local execution, proof, and efficient asset transfers. The State Model combines Ethereum's account model, Bitcoin's UTXO model, and ZK-proofs, addressing state bloat by storing commitments instead of the full state. Operators manage the global state, while users are incentivized to store data locally, maximizing privacy and minimizing state growth.\n\nPolygon Supernets\n\nPolygon Supernets is an app-chain-focused scaling solution for Polygon PoS that is in testnet as of May 18, 2023. Polygon Supernets aim to expand the blockspace of Polygon PoS by providing both Layer-2 and Layer-3 networks for specific applications. Polygon Supernets are EVM-compatible, allowing applications built on Polygon PoS to achieve greater throughput and cheaper transaction costs.\n\nDuring Q4 2022 and Q1 2023, Polygon announced <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-polygon-q4-2022?referrer=asset:polygon\">several partnerships</a> and collaborations with companies developing their own Supernets. Notably, the IDEX team shared plans for XCHAIN, a DEX-focused zk-rollup appchain that will function as a Polygon ZK Supernet, utilizing Polygon's zkEVM.\n\nPolygon Supernets V0.9, released in Q2 2023, introduces expanded allowlists and transaction blocklists, staking and token separation support, NFT bridge integration, transaction fee management, deployment optimizations, and enhanced access management. It brings Polygon closer to its goal of creating \"super networks\" with scalability and sovereignty. A comprehensive source code audit is ongoing to ensure compliance and security, with migration support planned for future releases.\n\nEcosystem Overview\n\nTVL\n\nPolygon's TVL experienced a challenging period during the 2022 bear market, with consistent declines in each quarter. However, in Q1 2023, the TVL stabilized, and this stability carried over into Q2 2023. Polygon concluded the quarter with a TVL of $1.09 billion, securing its position as the fifth-ranked chain in terms of TVL.\n\nTVL Top Protocols\n\nPolygon's top protocols by TVL demonstrated stability throughout the second quarter, maintaining their positions. The leading protocols in terms of TVL are the established blue chips Aave (V2 and V3) with $206 million and $251 million respectively, followed by Uniswap V3 with $88 million TVL, Quickswap DEX with $71 million, Curve with $62 million, and Balancer V2 with $54 million.\n\nNotably, there were two additions to the top ten list during the quarter. PearlFi, a ve(3,3) exchange launched in mid-June, quickly gained traction and achieved a TVL of $42 million within a few weeks of going live on mainnet. On the other hand, Compound V3, an established lending protocol, entered the top ten after launching on Polygon in March. Its TVL steadily increased and reached $40 million by the end of Q2.\n\nThe combined TVL of protocols outside the top ten was $200 million.\n\nDEXs\n\nIn Q2, Polygon's DEXs averaged $124 million in daily volume and accumulated a total quarterly volume of $11.3 billion. Uniswap V3 maintained its position as the leading DEX, accounting for 43% of the total DEX volume on Polygon. Quickswap V3 followed closely with 21% of the volume, and MetaTdex contributed 19% to the overall volume. The remaining DEXs on the network accounted for 18% of the cumulative volume. With a total cumulative volume of $138.94 billion, Polygon ranks third in all-time DEX volume, trailing only Ethereum and BNB Chain.\n\nLiquid Staking\n\nAt the end of Q2, Polygon experienced an increase in liquid staked MATIC, reaching 221 million MATIC, which represents 37% QoQ growth. This growth can be attributed to Lido's integration of five new node operators in early May. Lido stands as the leading liquid staking protocol on Polygon, with 138 million liquid staked MATIC, accounting for 62% of the total. Stader follows with 77 million liquid staked MATIC, constituting 35% of the total.\n\nLiquid staking on Polygon represents a fraction of the total staked MATIC (5.8%).\n\nStablecoins\n\nDuring Q1 2023, USDC, which has historically been the <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/state-of-polygon-q1-2023?referrer=asset:polygon\">dominant</a> stablecoin on Polygon, experienced a significant decrease in market cap due to Circle's exposure to Silicon Valley Bank. By the end of Q1, USDT emerged as the top stablecoin on Polygon, with a market cap of $735 million, representing 48% of the total stablecoin market cap. Meanwhile, USDC's market cap settled at $593 million, accounting for 38% of the market cap.\n\nIn the second quarter, USDT saw a decline of $137 million in market cap, closing the quarter at $598 million, representing 41.6% of the total stablecoin market cap. In contrast, USDC's market cap remained relatively stable QoQ, reaching $600 million, equaling 41.8% of the total market cap, allowing it to regain the lead by a narrow margin.\n\nOverall, Polygon's stablecoin market cap experienced a 7% decline QoQ, moving from $1.54 billion to $1.44 billion. Polygon closed the quarter with the sixth-largest stablecoin market cap.\n\nNFTs\n\nPolygon's NFT ecosystem has shown resilience during the bear market, seeing continued growth in Q2 2023. The average weekly NFT sales volume on Polygon increased by 42% QoQ, reaching $8.6 million.\n\nOpen Sea remains the dominant NFT marketplace on Polygon, accounting for 84% of the total NFT volume in Q2. Magic Eden, which joined the network in Q1, secured the second spot with a 9% market share.\n\nSeveral leading NFT collections on Polygon contributed to the network's success, including Lama Kings, Doodle Changs, y00ts, Bungo Beanz, and Super Pengs.\n\nPolygon's NFT ecosystem has attracted the attention of major brands and organizations. Starbucks announced plans to launch its second NFT collection on Polygon, while Sports Illustrated opted to leverage Polygon for its new NFT ticketing service called Box Office. Moreover, attendees at the Monaco Grand Prix had the opportunity to receive their tickets as NFTs on Polygon, showcasing the network's practical applications.\n\nPolygon has also been actively promoting music NFTs and supporting the development of Web3 music applications. In partnership with Warner Music Group, they have established a music accelerator program to foster innovation in this space, further highlighting Polygon's commitment to the intersection of music and blockchain technology.\n\nGaming\n\nPolygon gaming has shown considerable growth within the Polygon ecosystem. In Q1, Polygon boasted the <a href=\"https://messari.io/report/users-across-evm-chains?referrer=all-research\">highest number</a> of active gamers among all EVM chains. Throughout Q2, the top-performing games on Polygon included Pixels, Arc8, Benji Bananas, Sunflower Land, Decentral Games, and Skyweaver. Additionally, Polygon has previously announced several notable partnerships and collaborations, involving companies such as Superlayer, Delab Games, AQUA, Immutable, and Nexon.\n\nAdditional Highlights  \n\nCrypto Native\n\nTaurus integrates Polygon on its tokenization and custody platforms, allowing clients to tokenize any asset and leverage Polygon's benefits.\nSolana wallet Phantom expands to Ethereum and Polygon, allowing users to transact across all three blockchains and providing features for NFT holders such as floor price data and direct listing on marketplaces.\nThe Graph now supports Polygon. Developers on Polygon can begin migrating subgraphs over to The Graph network.\n\nInstitutional\n\nFranklin Templeton, one of the world's largest asset managers, launched its Nasdaq-listed OnChain U.S. Government Money Fund (FOBXX) on the Polygon blockchain, making it the first U.S.-registered fund to use a blockchain for transactions and share ownership.\nSecuritize expanded liquidity potential and access to Hamilton Lane's Senior Credit Opportunities Fund via Polygon, offering on-demand redemptions and a fully-digitized subscription process.\nBrazil-based BTG Pactual, Latin America's biggest investment bank, launched its own stablecoin called BTG Dol on the Polygon blockchain, providing clients with a dollar-backed asset.\nMastercard is collaborating with Solana, Aptos, Polygon, and Avalanche to establish common crypto standards and create the Mastercard Crypto Credential.  \n\nSustainability\n\nRegen Network has partnered with Toucan to launch a bridge to the Polygon network, enabling the issuance and tokenization of carbon credits on Regen Network and establishing the Nature Carbon Tonne (NCT) as the first digital carbon token in the Cosmos ecosystem.\nSolid World launches liquidity pools for carbon markets on the Polygon PoS network, aiming to democratize access and scale financing for nature-based carbon projects worldwide.\n\nDecentralization and Staking Overview\n\nPolygon PoS operates as a Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) sidechain for Ethereum, allowing users to become validators and contribute to network security while earning rewards. However, the number of active validators on Polygon PoS is capped at 100. As of the end of Q2, the validator set is full, and new validators can only join if an existing validator exits.\n\nStaking rewards on Polygon PoS are allocated in MATIC tokens on Ethereum. Rewards are proportional to a validator's stake relative to all active validators and include a 10% bonus for successfully submitting a checkpoint on the Heimdall layer. Validators also receive native MATIC transaction fees for proposing blocks on the Bor layer.\n\nAs of the end of Q2 2023, the five largest MATIC validators, by the amount staked, are cumulatively staking 1.52 billion MATIC (39.5% of the total MATIC staked, or 15.2% of the total token supply). The five largest validators are as follows:\n\nLuganodes: 431.7 million ERC-20 MATIC staked (11.3% of the total stake).\nBinanceNode: 359.7 million ERC-20 MATIC staked (9.4% of the total stake).\nWeb3NodesValidator: 263.4 million ERC-20 MATIC staked (6.9% of the total stake).\nCoinbase Cloud: 252.7 million ERC-20 MATIC staked (6.6% of the total stake).\nAllnodes.com: 209.6 million ERC-20 MATIC staked (5.5% of the total stake).\n\nNote: Polygon 2.0 will revamp the validator model and validator payout scheme. See the Polygon 2.0 - Architecture and Tokenomics sections for further details.\n\nStake\n\nThe percentage of MATIC staked continues to gradually increase, reaching 3.84 billion MATIC (38% of the total supply) by the end of Q2.\n\nGovernance\n\nPolygon Governance 2.0 introduces three main governance pillars for the Polygon ecosystem. Protocol Governance, System Smart Contract Governance, and Community Treasury Governance. Each pillar of governance will have its own unique governance framework, aiming to create scalable and efficient governance mechanisms.\n\nProtocol Governance: Facilitated by the Polygon Improvement Proposal (PIP) framework, providing a platform for proposing upgrades to Polygon protocols.\nSystem Smart Contracts Governance: Addresses upgrades of protocol components implemented as smart contracts. The Ecosystem Council, governed by the community, will be responsible for these upgrades.\nCommunity Treasury Governance_: Establishes a self-sustainable ecosystem fund, the Community Treasury, to support public goods and ecosystem projects. The governance process involves two phases, starting with an independent Community Treasury Board and evolving into community-driven decision-making.\n\nCommunity participation is encouraged by Polygon Labs through feedback and proposals. The PIP Bounty Program rewards exceptional submissions, with $40,000 allocated over one year. The framework covers core improvements, contracts on Ethereum, API specifications, and informational PIPs.\n\nClosing Summary\n\nDespite a difficult U.S. regulatory environment during Q2, Polygon's financial and network fundamentals were unaffected. Polygon announced a host of new protocol updates and partnerships during the quarter, showing continued resilience.  \n  \nThe standout news of the quarter was the launch of Polygon 2.0. This is a network of zk L2s, conceived to become the \"Value Layer of the Internet.\" Polygon 2.0 brings with it significant enhancements in protocol architecture, tokenomics, and governance, marking a pivotal step in the network's evolution.  \n  \nRunning concurrently, the Polygon zkEVM continued its growth trajectory, showcasing impressive collaborations and integrations. By the end of the quarter, it had reached 200,000 unique addresses.  \n  \nPolygon's developer and user bases are among the most expansive in crypto, and it remains committed to pushing the boundaries. As competition intensifies, the successful rollout of Polygon 2.0 and continued adoption of the Polygon zkEVM will become increasingly critical in the coming quarters.",
